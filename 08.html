.center.text-xl[
helpful feedback

respectful collaboration
]

???
As I discussed last week, my team has a meeting twice a month just to discuss how we're working together and to improve upon that. Good collaboration is an intentional practice.

# Work time on projects

- Prioritize cards on your board
- Begin sketching or designing homepage

???
- may not prioritize all, but at least first 3
- remember that your design should be informed by the priority guide

# What is inclusive design?

???
- Accessibility is disability focused
- Inclusive design is, well, more inclusive
- b/c our understanding of disability is too narrow

---

# Inclusive design

.center.img-w-40[![impairment spectrum](08/spectrum.png)]

???
- Accessibility focuses narrowly on permanent impairments or disabilities
- Impairments may be situational, temporary or permanent
- Needs shift with time and circumstance
- Inclusive design is also about sensitivity, per the reading
- This helps make use case for accessibility: it's not just a small subset of users

# Inclusive design

## mismatched interactions.
]

???
- As designers, it’s our responsibility to know how our designs affect these interactions and create mismatches.
- At the end of the day, if you do not design inclusively, you are designing to exclude, creating barriers to participation
- This is why I use the term inclusive design vs accessibility or universal design; inclusive design is a social justice issue
- In 2017, 55% of US HR managers said they thought AI would be a regular part of their work before 2022
- But this year we learned that Amazon's AI hiring project was biased against female candidates
    - penalized resumes with the word "women's" in them (e.g., women's chess club captain)
    - penalized grads from women's colleges

Design feedback
- 1 example each:
  - helpful feedback that led to a breakthrough, led to you seeing something anew
  - unhelpful feedback that was vague or hurtful
- Examples of strategy you've used to _get_ good feedback
5m to brainstorm on your own
5m to share with someone you're not on a team with
5m to discuss as a group
  - who has thinks they have the best example of unhelpful feedback?
  - helpful feedback?

Comment, question or quote from design feedback reading

Expectation: commit to helpful feedback, respectful collaboration
As I discussed last week, my team has a meeting twice a month just to discuss how we're working together and to improve upon that. Good collaboration is an intentional practice.

What is inclusive design?
- Comment, question or quote from design for real life
- Inclusive design is not just about blindness:
  - permanent, temporary, situational impairments
p42: file:///Users/ajw/Downloads/inclusive_toolkit_manual_final.pdf
  - sensitivity per reading
  - this helps make use case for accessibility: it's not just a small subset of users
  - at the end of the day, if you do not design inclusively, you are designing to exclude, creating barriers to participation

Disability happens at the points of interaction between a person and society.
Physical, cognitive, and social exclusion is the result of mismatched interactions.
As designers, itâ€™s our responsibility to know how our designs affect these interactions and create mismatches.

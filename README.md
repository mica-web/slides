# GD 431 Slides
This is an archive of the slides as taught in Fall 2018.

These slides were prepared using Markdown and a JS slide generator ([Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark/) 👍).

If you are looking for PDF versions of the slides, they are included after class in the [weekly schedule](https://mica-web.github.io/gd-431/#schedule).

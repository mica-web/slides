# Homework
.text-xl[Begin work on one of the following for your site redesign:]

### 1. An interior page with a form on it

???
What do I mean by an interior page?

This must be a form that‚Äôs more complex than a search form, a subscription form or a basic contact-us form

--
count: false

### 2. A page with an interactive element on it

???
Other than the mobile menu we created in class
Possibilities: image gallery and carousel, FAQ accordion

--
count: false

### 3. (Re)designed search results page

???
If your site does not have search, reach out to me to discuss your options here!

--
count: false

### 4. Either a 404 error page or a branded smartwatch notification

???
In the case of the smartwatch notification, this can be design only (ie, you can turn in an image file vs markup)

Commit to what you‚Äôre working on next in your project Slack channel.
Like the homepage, this new page should be mobile-first and responsive (exception: smartwatch notification).

By the end of the semester, everyone's project will include these four things. What order you tackle them is up to you.

Questions?

Create a pull request to get feedback on your project‚Äôs organization and code before November 19.

I won't be grading work at this time, just providing feedback.

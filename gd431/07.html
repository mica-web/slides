# Team up

| Project 1 | Stakeholder | Design/Dev |
|-------------------- |------------- |------------ |
| AVAM | Lauren | Yana |

???
Worth noting, going forward, the rest of today is going to be a lot of collaboration, not so much info sharing from me to you.
We'll try to keep an eye on the clock and evaluate best dinner break, but it may not be 6pm on the nose

# Share and read evaluations

## Finished early?

- Look at the site yourself
- Don't forget to look at its mobile view

???
10m to read eval

For this first group, we're going to step through things together and do some explanation along the way. Group 2 will do these same activities later.

# Discuss the evaluation

## Ask your stakeholder:

.text-xl[
- What do you like most about your current site?
- What’s the problem you’re trying to solve?
- What does your target audience want?
- What will success look like to you?
]

???
- 5m, then will check in

# Identify + discuss issues

???
Document issues with the current site on Post-Its

Based on the stakeholder's evaluation document

But an opportunity to update based on the convo you just had and any insights from your dev/designer

First, let's take a minute to get on the same page about what makes a helpful issue

--
count: false

.text-xl[
An issue describes:
- something about the site as is
- a user goal
]

???
Issues, however, are not the same thing as solutions and, at this point, you want to avoid delving into solutions. We're focused on understanding the problems at this phase.

.center[
## Issues ≠ Solutions
]

???
A content slider/carousel is a solution. No user ever asked for one. The **issue** a content slider may solve is that users need a way to get info about multiple events at a glance.

Pause and check for understanding

As examples, these are a major improvement.

Pause to read issues aloud

These issues may actually be part of what motivated us to think the homepage needs a redesign, but they're much more informative and actionable

Still, you may also notice that these issues are all around navigation and want to combine them, but you should resist this urge.

First, you should write out each issue individually and only look to combine things when you're both truly done.

When you _do_ look to gather similar issues together, it's important not to do so under too **generic** of a label. If I replaced these four issues with one that was just titled "navigation issues" a lot of important detail would be lost. I can ask myself, "Does the navigation still overlap on mobile?" If it doesn't, I know I've made an improvement...it's harder to do this the more generic I get, however.

# Identify + discuss issues

## Example issues

???
This isn't to say you can't combine issues, but you want to do so in a way where
1. you don't lose the original issues
2. you still have a good sense of how to judge if this issue has been improved/resolved

## Priority matrixes

???
- At this point, we have an understanding of the current situation for the business, the site and the UX
- We also have a list of heuristics and a list of issues derived from those
- We could treat that as a checklist for your projects
- How many issues did you end up with?
- As a designer, I might be overwhelmed a bit if you gave me 35 things to fix all in one go.
- Reality is that time and resources are finite and sometimes don't let us accomplish all the things, all at once.

--

???
- We can't actually Do All The Things
- A checklist -- or a stack of Post-Its, in this case -- doesn't actually make sure you're spending your energy (or that the client/company is spending their money) on the right things
- Start by establishing two metrics against which you want to consider and evaluate your issues

## Priority matrixes

- Start by establishing two metrics against which you want to consider and evaluate your issues
- Business impact:  Does it bring you more customers, more purchases, etc
- If yes, goes toward the top of the chart

Secondary metric: user value
- Does it make something simpler, clearer for the user?
- Does it allow more users to be more successful or efficient?
- If yes, it goes to the right of the chart

Things that end up in the upper right of this chart are **obvious wins**: they are issues that, if tackled, will improve the user experience and the bottom line of the business

---

## Priority matrixes

.img-w-95.right[

In the bottom left are issues you can reasonable snooze on: they are low impact on your business and low value to your users

???
- In the upper left and bottom right there are no easy solutions -- these are issues that skew one direction or another.
- They shouldn't be ignored, but they can be prioritized _after_ the items in the top right and you can balance your priorities going forward by choosing some issues from each of these areas.

---

## Create a priority matrix

.text-xl[

After you've organized/assigned your issues:

1. Put a dot/star/mark on each issue in the upper right; these are your **obvious wins**
2. Do you agree that the low-impact issues can be ignored?
3. Are any of the remaining cards worth discussing and elevating?
    - If so, don't move them on the matrix, but also mark them with a dot/star
]
???
- For this exercise, avoid using your laptops or devices.
- If you need to double-check something against the existing web site, put those Post-Its aside and handle them together at the end
- 10m, then will check in
- if no large post-it pages, use and introduce mural.ly instead: https://app.mural.co/t/micaweb1831/m/micaweb1831/1539234446546/97631b900bc18d6564b4157b358a35357d0a4b38

- **Modifying** an existing element
- **Combining** existing elements
- **Eliminating** an element

- As before, no laptops or devices.
- Generate ideas for possible solutions to your issues
- Not committing to anything at this point, purely brainstorming
- If you need to double-check something against the existing web site, put those Post-Its aside and handle them together at the end.

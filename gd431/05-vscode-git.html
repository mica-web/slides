1. Download Visual Studio Code
    - if you haven't already and don't have a text editor you're comfortable with
    - all my examples going forward -- including how to compile Sass on your local machine, how to update your projects on GitHub -- will use Visual Studio Code, so I *highly* recommend using this editor for the class

# Understanding git

???
- type of version control
- functionality you may be familiar with from word documents: track changes, undo/redo
- you can see what changed, who changed it and why
- also can *revert* to previous versions of code
- remembers things even after you deleted 'em

## `git init`

.center.img-w-50[![empty directory](05/git1.png)]

???
- we talked before about track changes, but that only works for a single document/object
- git isn't just for one file, but a snapshot of a whole project (which git calls a repository)

- not limited by number of files or types of files
- changes in yr working directory do not autosync; up to the user

## `git add`

???
- or several/all
- changes are still in this middle zone, not yet attached to the project
- we do that via `git commit`

---
background-image: url(05/git_commit.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center

## `git commit`

???
- a commit is not the same as a save
    - save is to your working directory, always local
- commit submits your changes to the local repository, to the history of the project
- we'll talk more in detail about commits shortly, but for now the important distinction is that a commit is to your project history, a save is to your working directory

If you have already pushed to GitHub from the machine you're using right now, you may be able to skip some steps here

# Getting started with VS Code

- Interface basics
- Update some helpful settings of VS Code
- Add some useful extensions to VS Code

# VS Code + git

???
- `git init`
- `git status`
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git diff`
- `git log --oneline`


---

## Git branches

.text-xl.center[
`git branch`
]

???
- In the VS Code integrated terminal, type `git branch` to see a list of branches for your repo; right now, you should see only one: master
- By default, git has created this initial branch for you

--
count: false

.center[![branches in VS Code UI](05/branch-master.png)]

???
- You can also see what branch you're working on in the the VS Code status bar, on the far left


---

## Git branches

.center[![creating a branch in git](05/branch3.png)]

???
- So, this whole time we've been saving our commits to master; which is one way to go -- but it's less than ideal; let's explore another way
- We use branches to isolate our work, especially when working on teams, and, in this course, to get feedback on things via pull requests (which is a request to have your branch be integrated or merged into the master branch)

---

## Git branches

???
- Creating a new branch is like using "File save as..." on a document; it takes the current state of your repo and creates a duplicate of it

--
count: false

.center[
### `git branch {new-branch-name}`
]

???
- branch names cannot have spaces in them
- you'll be typing them a lot, so it helps to be brief
- note that this command only creates the new branch; you're still inside of and working within the master branch

--
count: false

.center[
### `git checkout {new-branch-name}`
]

???
- `checkout` switches which branch you're on
- Note, the branch is always created based on the branch you're currently on
- This seems obvious now b/c we've only been dealing with one branch, but it can def muck up your day if you forget it

- Of course, while master and our new branch have diverged, at some point we're going to want to connect them back up together again
- We do this via a process called merging

???
- going forward, no changes directly to **master**
- create `styles` directories inside `resume` and `poster`
- **REMEMBER**
    - You'll need to link to your styles from your HTML in the `head`
        - `link` + `tab` in Emmet
    - You'll also need to link to or maybe recreate any external stylesheets used
        - Google Fonts
        - my utilities classes
        - check by going to the CSS Settings on your CodePen and looking under "Add External Stylesheets/Pens"

]

---
count: false

# Migrating from CodePen to VS Code

.center.text-xl[
`git push origin migrate-from-codepen`
] 

???
- `git push` is the command to take code from your local git repo and share it with GitHub in the cloud
- `origin` is the name of your remote repo
    - this is the default set when you originally connected up your project on GitHub
    - git and GitHub are full of useful defaults (remember how you had a master branch without ever creating it?)
- `migrate-from-codepen` is the name of your branch
- so, broken down, this command says, hey, git, take the changes from my current branch and push them to a similarly named branch on GitHub

--
count: false

.center.img-w-45[![git push from UI](05/git-push.png)]

???
- you can also do this through the UI
- click the three dots on the far right of the source control sidebar
- verify on GitHub.com

# Best practices for commits

---

## A commit represents work that is

.text-xl[
- Modular
- Connected
]

???
- A unit of work; note that we treated the migration of each project as its own commit; it doesn't make sense to commit changes to 2 homework assignments at once
- A commit is not a reference to a working period (e.g., "Friday's work") because you would never want to undo a whole day; you'd much more likely want to undo discrete bits of that day's work
- We just treated the whole migration from CodePen for your projects project as two commits; how else could this have been broken up?

--
count: false

.text-xl[
1. Add web fonts
1. Add JS for flyout menu
1. Make header responsive
1. Fix typo
]

???
- Do we see how these things are modular?
- Flyout menu JS may in fact be used in making the header responsive, but since it involves making a new file, it should be in its own commit
- Separate, when possible, making new files vs modifying existing
- Separate renaming files, deleting files


---

## Tasks as commits

???
- Common issue for new git users is to get lost in the work and forget to commit; this muddies the water and makes it harder to understand your changes, your intent and definitely impacts your ability to undo things
- If it helps, write out a task list _before_ you start coding; each one of those tasks could be a commit

--
count: false

.text-xl[
1. Add web fonts
1. Add JS for flyout menu
1. Make header responsive
1. Fix typo
]

???
- You can even do this in your git repo!
- `todo.md`
- Go to code editor to explain this

---

## Best practices for commit messages

.text-xl[
- Be useful
- Be brief (~50 char)
]

--
count: false

.text-xl[
- Start with a verb in the present tense, like giving a command:
    - Update body font to Roboto
    - Fix typo in nav
    - Note tense: not updates or fixed
]

--
count: false

.text-xl[
- Doesn't need to mention which file you worked on

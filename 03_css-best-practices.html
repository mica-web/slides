## The cascade

</iframe>

???
- Cascading stylesheets
- From top to bottom in the stylesheet
- Top to bottom in the order of declarations
- Actual math to calculate the specificity of CSS selectors, but high level, what you need to know is:
- `!important`
- inline styles
- IDs more weight than classes which have more weight than base elements
- Don't use `!important` to get around understanding the cascade and controlling it with more expertise

---

## CSS defaults

### Inline elements
### Block-level elements

???
- There are other display settings in CSS, but these are the main defaults of elements you'll encounter
- `table`, `list-item`

---
background-image: url(03/browser-defaults.gif)
class: bkgd-contain

## Browser defaults

???
font-size, padding, margins, appearance of form elements, buttons


---

## Best practices

Use classnames over bare elements or IDs

???
- More often than not, you don't really intend to style all DIVs or SPANs in a project
- Classes are reusable
- We'll get into more detail about this later

--
count: false

```html
<h1 class="page-title cursive"></h1>
```

???
- An element can have multiple classes
- Remember that they are case sensitive

--
count: false

Write your CSS lowercase and kebab case
--
count: false

```css
.page-title {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

```

???
- Resembles CSS itself
- Exception: font names

--
count: false

Transform case using CSS

???
- Less brittle
- Can change all at once

--
count: false

Remember your semicolon

???
- Technically, the last semicolon in a ruleset is optional
- This causes more headaches than it's worth, so just always end with a semicolon

---

## Best practices

Learn about methods of organizing CSS/Sass and use a system

???
- We'll talk more in depth about this shortly
- Systems exist to help devs organize their code and name their classes/variables

--
count: false

.left-float.col-2.text-sm[

```css
div {
  background-color: whitesmoke;
  border: 3px dotted #f9c7dd;
  color: #444;
  display: inline-block;
  font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
  font-size: 100%;
  padding: 1em;
}
```

]

???
- My strategy
- Alphabetized by properties; can always tell if a thing has been set without searching
- Minimizes chance of writing duplicate declarations

--
count: false

.right-float.col-2.text-sm[

```css
div {
  /* -- Box -- */
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 1em;

  /* -- Border -- */
  border: 3px dotted #f9c7dd;


  /* -- Background -- */
  background-color: whitesmoke;

  /* -- Text -- */
  color: #444;
  font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
  font-size: 100%;
}
```

]

???
- Also common to group properties by some common logic
- Nice b/c like is with like
- To me, just too much mental overhead to remember the categories and their order
- Jonathon Snook's case for grouping declarations: https://smacss.com/book/formatting

---

## Best practices

Use CSS comments

???
- Break things up
- Make your organization more clear: I just did this in the previous example
- Essential in teams
- Also, helpful to future you!

--
count: false

```css
/*
* === SITE HEADER ===
*/
```

```css
/*
* --- Header nav ---
*/

```

???
- Break things up
- Make your organization more clear: I just did this in the previous example
- Essential in teams
- Also, helpful to future you!

---

## Best practices

Avoid `!important`

???
- Often what is called a "bad code smell"
- Used b/c of a lack of understanding of how CSS works

---

## Best practices

Avoid using empty `div`s to achieve your styles

```html
<div class="something-fancy"></div>
```

---

## Best practices

Measurements of zero don't need units

--
count: false

.left-float.col-2[
### Avoid

```css
div {
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;
  width: 0px;
}
```
]

.right-float.col-2[
### Do this

```css
div {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  width: 0;
}
```
]

---

## Best practices

Avoid overdoing your selectors and specificity

--
count: false

.left-float.col-2.text-sm[

```html
<header class="site-header">
  <nav class="nav-bar">
    <ul class="nav-menu">
      <li class="nav-menu__item"></li>
      <li class="nav-menu__item"></li>
      <li class="nav-menu__item"></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

]

???
Just b/c your HTML looks like this...

--
count: false

.right-float.col-2.text-sm[

### Avoid

```css
header.site-header nav.nav-bar ul.nav-menu li.nav-menu__item {}
```

]

???
...doesn't mean your CSS needs to look like this

--
count: false

.right-float.col-2.text-sm[

### Do this

```css
.nav-menu__item {}
```

.center[
  OR
]

```css
.site-header .nav-menu__item {}
```

]

???
- Harder to maintain this CSS
- Harder to override your CSS b/c you were too specific from the start

---

## Best practices

Avoid making unnecessary assumptions about the markup


### Avoid
```html
<span class="highlight"><a href='#'>Highlighted link</a></span>
```

```css
.highlight a { background: yellow; }
```

--
count: false

### Do this

```html
<a href='#' class="highlight">Highlighted link</a>
```

```css
.highlight { background: yellow; }
```

???
- DOM and markup can and will change over time
- Target the element you want to use from the start
- Instead of “finding it” through its parents
- If you don't control the markup, this may be out of your hands -- WordPress plugins, fr'ex--, but look for places to fix/avoid when you do have the full control

---

## Best practices

Avoid writing CSS you don't need

--
count: false

```css
div { display: block; }
```

???
- Don't restate default CSS values

--
count: false

```css
div { margin: 0 auto; }
/* This is the margin shorthand. It's the equivalent of: */
/*  margin-top: 0;      */
/*  margin-right: auto; */
/*  margin-bottom: 0; */
/*  margin-left: auto; */
```

???
- Don't set things to zero just to use the shorthand property

---

## Best practices

Avoid writing CSS you're immediately going to override

--
count: false

### Avoid

```css
li {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-left: 14px;
}
li:first-of-type { margin-left: 0; }
```

--
count: false

### Do this

```css
li { display: inline-block; }
li + li { margin-left: 14px; }
```

???
sibling selector

---

## Best practices

Avoid making an HTTP request for a resource when you can easily replicate the element with CSS

.left-float.col-2[
### Avoid

```css
li::before {
  content: url(green-circle.svg);
}
```

]

--
count: false

.right-float.col-2[
### Do this

```css
li::before {
  background: green;
  border-radius: 50%;
  content: "";
  display: block;
  height: 20px;
  width: 20px;
}
```

### Normalize.css (group 2)
  - Read about it: http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/
  - View the code: https://codepen.io/angeliquejw/pen/rZYXOz?editors=0100

Extra time? https://css-tricks.com/reboot-resets-reasoning/

???
- 1s and 2s
- On your own:
  - Read the first link
  - 6 mins; if you have extra time, either read the code link or the CSS-Tricks article

---

## Learn about resets

1. Join your group

2. Establish roles:
  - Timekeeper
  - Presenter
--

3. As a group, spend 10 mins discussing:
  - 3-5 main things to know
  - 2 pros and 2 cons

???
- As your group:
  - Pick someone to watch time time and someone to present (who should also take notes)
  - Figure out 3-5 main things to know about reset/normalize
  - 2 pros and 2 cons to using this
  - 10 mins

## Utility classes

<iframe height='520' scrolling='no' title='Utility classes example' src='//codepen.io/angeliquejw/embed/wEpvqN/?height=520&theme-id=15346&default-tab=css&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/angeliquejw/pen/wEpvqN/'>Utility classes example</a> by Angelique (<a href='https://codepen.io/angeliquejw'>@angeliquejw</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

.text-xs[
  https://codepen.io/angeliquejw/pen/wEpvqN?editors=0100
]

???
- Very simple styles that accomplish a single thing
- Often have only 1 css rule with 'em
- Both resets and utility classes can be used in multiple projects; this is CSS you write once and use again and again

---

## Base styles

--
count: false

```css
body {
  background: whitesmoke;
  color: #1b203a;
  font-family: "Fira Sans", Sans-Serif;
  margin: 0;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, li {
  line-height: 1.5625em;
  margin: 0;
}
```

???
- Set the initial layout, including background color, font, font color
- Styles applied to elements without classes, often table, input, button, headings

---
class: center, middle

## Custom CSS

???
- Finally to the meat of what you probably think of when you think of writing CSS
- Use classes
- Group things when they are like for a reason, not like just because

---
class: center, middle

## Structuring your CSS Q&A

---

## CSS Naming Conventions

???
- Follow a naming convention
- Name things based on content/meaning/function vs look
- BEM for beginners

---
class: center, middle

## BEM
--
count: false

### Block

???
- Independent component
- Name describes its purpose, not what it looks like
- Name can include a hyphen if it's two words
- Blocks can be nested inside blocks
--
count: false

```css
.block {}
```
--
count: false

### Element

???
- Child of the component, some bit that helps make it whole
- Can't be used outside of its parent block
- Don't string together children
- Just because something is part of a parent block, does not necessarily mean it will be an element
- Relationships are what matter here
--
count: false

```css
.block__element {}
```
--
count: false

### Modifier

???
- Not a thing, but a state or version of a block or element
- Overall, understand purpose and relationships more clearly
--
count: false

```css
.block--modifier {}
.block__element--modifier {}
```

---

## BEM examples

```html
<figure class="photo">
  <img class="photo__img" src="me.jpg">
  <figcaption class="photo__caption">C'est moi!</figcaption>
</figure>
```
--
count: false

```css
.photo {}
.photo__img {}
.photo__caption {}
```

---
count: false

## BEM examples

```html
<figure class="photo photo--featured">
  <img class="photo__img" src="me.jpg">
  <figcaption class="photo__caption">C'est moi!</figcaption>
</figure>
```
--
count: false

```css
.photo {}
.photo__img {}
.photo__caption {}

.photo--featured {}
.photo--featured .photo__img {}
.photo--featured .photo__caption {}
```

???
In general, BEM discourages nesting selectors, but this is a good use case for it -- the parent photo element has the modifier "featured" and this may or may not change the child elements

---

## BEM examples

```html
<form action="#" class="search-form">

  <input class="search-form__input" type="search">
  <button class="button search-form__button" type="submit"></button>

</form>
```

???
button is a block and and element here

---

## BEM variations

### By the book

```html
<button class="button button--disabled" type="submit"></button>
```

```css
.button {}
.button--disabled {}
```

--
count: false

### Functional variation

```html
<button class="button" disabled type="submit"></button>
```

```css
.button {}
.button[disabled] {}
```

???
Button can't just look disabled, must functionally be disabled

---

## BEM variations

### By the book

```html
<section class="plans plans--hidden"></section>
```

```css
.plans {}
.plans--hidden {}
```

--
count: false

### Functional variation

```html
<section class="plans" hidden></section>
```

```css
.plans {}
.plans[hidden] {}
```

???
Still use modifiers, but not if existing attributes can be leveraged
---

## Criticisms of BEM

- Ugly

???
- I was in this camp, too, for a long time
- Working as a team, just helpful to have some consensus about things
--
count: false

- More typing

???
- Initially, yes
- We'll talk more about workarounds when we start working on CSS
- PROS:  helps you achieve the low-level specificity; encourages very reusable elements

---

## Naming things well

???
BEM provides a structure, a set of expectations for how to name things -- but there's still a lot to be considered as to what makes a good name

--
count: false

- Understandable

???
Things that factor into this:  industry, your specific organization and product

--
count: false

- Obvious

???
- Don't let a cute or clever idea get in the way of being understandable
- Avoid overthinking it or applying another layer of abstraction

--
count: false

- Functional

???
To clarify, ask what a component’s function is, and not how the component functions.

--
count: false

- Consistent

???
BEM, fr'ex, prevents having a code base with the classes defaultButton and buttonDefault in it -- because it sets consistent expectations about naming

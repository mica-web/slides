# Poster recap

???
- Reminder that this was a more challenging project than the resume project.
- If your grade was lower this time around, it's not that you've gotten worse, it's that your tackling more complicated problems and writing more and more complex code

--
count: false

.text-xl[
- Keep your commits small and descriptive
]

???
- Avoid commits that say "change" -- that's what a commit is by its very nature, a change to the code; ask yourself, "What was the INTENT of my change(s)?"
- Aim to improve here in the next assignment

---

.left-float.col-2[
```scss
* {
  background-color: red;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 36px;
  font-weight: 200;
}
```
]

???
- Let's discuss what this does in reality

count: false

.right-float.col-2[
```scss
body {
  background-color: red;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 36px;
  font-weight: 200;
}
```
]

???
- vs body
- good idea to always declare a background color, fyi

---

```scss
html{
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

???
This doesn't mean *don't* use the universal selector, but just that you should understand what it's doing.

# Media queries

```scss
ul {
  color: green;
  font-size: 2em;
  list-style-type: none;
}
```

# Media queries

```scss
ul {
  color: green;
  font-size: 2em;
  list-style-type: none;
  
  @media screen and (max-width:600px) and (min-width:0px) {
    color: red;
    font-size: 2em;
    list-style-type: none;
  }
}
```

???
Two things going on here that we can and should avoid:
1. `min-width:0px` is implied, never necessary
2. font-size and list-style-type are repeated

In your media queries, you're not starting from scratch; media queries are ADDITIVE to the CSS you've already written

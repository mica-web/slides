- GUI = graphic user interface
- windows, mouse/pointer, icons
- if this is what we're all most familiar with, what's the other option?


---
# Terminal

## aka CLI (Command Line Interface)


???
There are some technical differences between these terms, but for the purposes of this class, we'll use them interchangeably. I'll probably use Terminal more often becase that's how the CLI built into VS code is labeled.

???
While this is the image that's popularized/familiar in the media (Mr Robot being a more recent example), there are legit reasons to use the command line, too. You won't need to use the command line often, but we'll use a bit today and throughout the class, so you'll get some familiarity. Particularly when you read resources and howtos about git, you'll often see references.

# Benefits of git


???
- what do you think the benefits of git are for you, not generically?
- any examples you can think of and share where git might have saved you?
- reading used an author, but that's obviously  not the common or only use case

# Benefits of git

![code review](img/02_git_help2.png)


???
- w/o GH, I just have to send you a doc and make comments like "on line 33, you xyz"...but, line 33 may be different for you locally vs the code I'm reviewing if you've made changes :(
- so, while getting new dev environments set up is difficult, stressful and a rough way to start a course, I really really believe it will be worthwhile for all of us

# Intro to git

# Before git

.center[![empty directory](img/02_git2.png)]


???
We have a directory of our project files: multiple files, can even include other directories. In no way limited by file type.


---
class: center, middle, title

# `git init`


???
- `init` is short for "initialize"
- the `git init` command says "This directory is now a git repo, git commands should work in here and maintain a record of changes"


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add1.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center
count: false

## `git init`


???
- `init` also gives us some git concepts: working directory, staging area and repo
- these are all **CONCEPTS**, not actual folders
- not about creating v1, v2, v3 of a file -- but identifying and knowing how git is tracking things
- working directory: where git is initialized, where you do your work
- there are commands to activate the other 2 concepts (staging and repo), so let's dig into those next
- @timer=5m/45


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add1.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center

## `git add`

???
- there are commands to activate the other 2 concepts (staging and repo), so let's dig into those next
- activates the **staging area**
- staging area: a holding cell for files you're going to add to your repo


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add2.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center
count: false

## `git add`


???
- can move a single file over


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add3.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center
count: false

## `git add`


???
- or several/all
- you do this every time you want to add your changes to the repo
- changes are still in this middle zone, not yet attached to the project repo
- we do that via `git commit`
- @timer=5m/50


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_commit.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center

## `git commit`


???
- we do that via `git commit`
- a **commit** applies all the changes in your staging area to the local repository and to the history of the project
- **repo**: git's current version of your project
- a commit is not the same as a save
- save is to your working directory, always local
- we'll talk more in detail about commits shortly, but for now the important distinction is that a commit is to your project history, a save is to your working directory
- if it's helpful, think of your code like prepping a care package:
    - add/staging is the prep before you mail the package, gathering up all the things that are going to go in your envelope or box
    - a commit is actually mailing the thing
    - while you can see a commit as the conclusion to a narrative, it's not that final: you can still send further letters/packages!

# Setting up basic project

## Mac

`/Users/yourusername/sites/gd2`

## Windows

`C:\sites\gd2`


???
- you'll need to create the "sites" directory/folder and the "gd2" directory
- all lowercase, no spaces
- all the coding you do in this class will be in the gd2 folder
- other files (comps, writing) you can put elsewhere in whatever structure you already use for organizing your coursework
- create the necessary directories and open the "gd2" folder in VS Code
- make sure your integrated terminal is also open
- put up post-it note when this is all done, pls
- @timer=5m/105


---

???
- switch to demo mode
- `git status` -- should result in error message
- git doesn't know about this folder
- does anyone remember the command to create a git repo?
- `git init`
- `git status`
- now have a git repo, but it only affects your local computer
- we want that repo to also be connect to GitHub
- create gd2 repo
    - some of you may have done this when you created your GH account
    - if you named it something else, you can rename it
      - settings, rename
- push an existing repository from the command line
  > `git remote add origin https://github.com/mica-web/test2.git`

- need to make a change to this repo so we can see those changes on GH
- create newfile `README.md`
- add this content to that file:
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/angeliquejw/6c6a5d1ab1a1f221902efa470b0776ef/raw/2700485c25ea67e2f4a50f12b7a055524ad97b7d/README.md
- add/stage these changes
- write your first commit
- `git status`
- git push via UI

- https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/
  > `git config --global github.user USERNAME`

  > `git config --global github.token YOUR_TOKEN`

  or

# git branches

---

# Git branches

.center[![creating a branch in git](img/02_branch3.png)]


???
- this is one way to go -- but it's less than ideal:
    - master is considered the authoritative source / production code
    - while I can look at your commits to master, it's not the best way to handle code review
- @timer=5m/125


---
count: false

# Git branches


???
- let's explore another way
- we use branches to isolate our work, especially when working on teams, and, in this course, to get feedback on things via pull requests (which is a request to have your branch be integrated or merged into the master branch)


---
count: false

# Git branches

.center[![creating a branch in git](img/02_branch4a.png)]

- creating a new branch is like using "File save as..." on a document; it takes the current state of your repo and creates a duplicate of it

# CodePen Demo


???
- strong vs b
    - semantics, meaning
    - for now, avoid looking to make visual changes to your markup; that's coming
    - for now, focus on what the meaning of the text is
    - strong = strong importance, seriousness, or urgency
    - b = bring attention to: keywords in a definition, product names
- em vs i
    - em = stresed emphasis in comparison to surrounding text
    - i = offset text for a variety of reasons, e.g. foreign word, technical terms, fictional character thoughts
- read and review MDN to double check your usage of these tags
- beginners get this confused a lot
- @timer=5m/60
- blockquotes
    - extended quote
    - can have other markup nested inside of it
- cite can be used in two ways
    - attribute of blockquote, giving source url

- more than 107k characters found in 90 writing systems
- UTF isn't default in all browsers
- Should always be first after `head` so everything after it is parsed correctly

### Git and Github in Plain English


???
- quotes
- comments/insights
- questions (last, as they will impact what we do next)

@timer=10m/25
- temperature check: how well do folks feel like they understand git at this point?


---

# Benefits of git


???
- what do you think the benefits of git are for you, not generically?
- any examples you can think of and share where git might have saved you?
- @timer=5m/30
- reading used an author, but that's obviously  not the common or only use case

# Benefits of git

![code review](img/02_git_help1.png)


???
- one of the reasons I'm keen to use git + GitHub here is for code review.
- examples of code review from last semester


---

# Benefits of git

![code review](img/02_git_help2.png)


???
- w/o GH, I just have to send you a doc and make comments like "on line 33, you xyz"...but, line 33 may be different for you locally vs the code I'm reviewing if you've made changes :(
- so, while getting new dev environments set up is difficult, stressful and a rough way to start a course, I really really believe it will be worthwhile for all of us

# Intro to git

# Understanding git


???
- type of version control
- lots of talk about how it's great for collaboration (many open source projects available via online git repos, like GitHub, which is what we'll be using)
- you can see what changed, who changed it and why
- also can *revert* to previous versions of code
- remembers things even after you deleted 'em
- functionality you may be familiar with from word documents: track changes, undo/redo

let's do a quick walkthrough of how things might work for a web project without git

this is alright, right? but, the moment you want to make a dramatic change, you want to try out a new layout or color scheme, you're in dire straits.


---

## Without version control


???
...that leads us to make this questionable choice; we've managed to save the previous state AND make our substantial changes.

but, it's unlikely to end there.

now, let's reset and consider how version control, specifically git, works and how it could have saved us here.

## `git init`

.center.img-w-50[![empty directory](img/02_git1.png)]


???
- we talked before about track changes, but that only works for a single document/object
- git isn't just for one file, but a snapshot of a whole project (which git calls a repository or repo for short)
- the `git init` command says "This directory is now a git repo, git commands should work in here and maintain a record of changes"

## `git init`


???
- not limited by number of files or types of files
- changes in yr working directory do not autosync; up to the user
- local "save" != git doing anything

---

## `git add`


???
- or several/all
- changes are still in this middle zone, not yet attached to the project
- we do that via `git commit`


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_commit.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center

## `git commit`


???
- a commit is not the same as a save
- save is to your working directory, always local
- commit submits your changes to the local repository, to the history of the project
- we'll talk more in detail about commits shortly, but for now the important distinction is that a commit is to your project history, a save is to your working directory

???
- open up VS Code
- make terminal visible

- control + ` (backtick) on win
- most of what we'll do w/ git in VS Code can be done via the GUI vs command line, but this requires the command line/terminal

# VS Code + git

1. in the browser, go to github and log in
1. create a GH repo
    - to keep things simple, make the repo name == the directory name
1. post it note verify @timer=5m/80
1. in VS Code, open your directory from last week
  - Sites/GD220
1. push an existing repository from the command line
> `git remote add origin https://github.com/mica-web/test2.git`
> `git push -u origin master`
- https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/

    - README.md
1. `git status`
1. add and commit via UI
1. diff via UI
1. push again via UI
1. verify on GitHub @timer=10m/100

# Best practices for commits

--
count: false

- **not** `Thursday's work`


???
- why is this less than ideal?
  > A commit is not a reference to a working period (e.g., "Friday's work") because you would never want to undo a whole day; you'd much more likely want to undo discrete bits of that day's work
- commit represents a task or chunk of work that is somehow connected
- common issue for new git users is to get lost in the work and forget to commit; this muddies the water and makes it harder to understand your changes, your intent and definitely impacts your ability to undo things
- if it helps, write out a task list _before_ you start working/coding; each one of those tasks could be a commit


---

## Best practices for commit messages

- Be useful
- Be brief (~50 char)

--
count: false

1. `Add new font files`
1. `Make header responsive`
1. `Fix typo`


???
- useful = what does this change?
- brief and starts with a verb in the present tense, like giving a command
- does **not** need to mention which file you worked on

## Git branches

--
count: false

![creating a branch in git](img/02_branch1.png)


???
when we created our repo, GH gave us a default branch, which is titled "master"


---
count: false

## Git branches

![creating a branch in git](img/02_branch2.png)


???
any commits we've added to date, have gone to this master branch


---
count: false

## Git branches

.center[![creating a branch in git](img/02_branch3.png)]


???
- this is one way to go -- but it's less than ideal:
    - master is considered the authoritative source / production code
    - while I can look at your commits to master, it's not the best way to handle code review
- let's explore another way
- we use branches to isolate our work, especially when working on teams, and, in this course, to get feedback on things via pull requests (which is a request to have your branch be integrated or merged into the master branch)
@timer=5m/125


---

## Git branches


???
- creating a new branch is like using "File save as..." on a document; it takes the current state of your repo and creates a duplicate of it

- while master and our new branch have diverged, at some point we're going to want to connect them back up together again
- we do this via a process called merging
@timer=5m/130

## Git branches in VS Code

.center[![branches in VS Code UI](img/02_branch-master.png)]


???
- in VS Code, you can see what branch you're working on in the the status bar, on the far left
- and can create new branches via UI
- branch names cannot have spaces in them


---

## Git branches in VS Code

.center.img-w-45[![git push from UI](img/02_git-push.png)]


???
- you can also do this through the UI
- click the three dots on the far right of the source control sidebar
- verify on GitHub.com

attributes
- provide additional info about the element

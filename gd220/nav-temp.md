# Common goals of navigation

## Where am I?

- Landmarks to ground the user: site logo, global nav, breadcrumbs, page/section titles

# Less-obvious functions of navigation

## What's present/possible?


???
By making the hierarchy visible, nav functions like a table of contents -- not just where I can go, but what is encompassed within the site's boundaries

count: false

## How do I use this site?


???
- Structure of nav implies where to begin and what order to do things

count: false

## How confident am I in the site/its creators?

# Wayfinding


???
We've talked mostly about what we provide to users--navigation. Let's jump back to the user experience of wayfinding for a few.


--
count: false

## Two types of users

???

- Looking for something in a store with my brother, I'll always be confident I can find a thing, he always looks for someone to ask; these same patterns exist on the web: link-dominant vs search-dominant behaviors; need to consider both

--
count: false

- ### link-dominant
- ### search-dominant


???

- Unlike a store, a web site has no sense of scale vs a store or museum
- No sense of direction
- Little sense of location; no "along the way" placemarkers
- @timer 3m / 34

---

# Additional Considerations

- ## Wording of navigation labels

???
- Think about how terms a user might search for (no one searches for "services," "products")
- Think about topics not formats


--
count: false

- ## Organization of navigation items


???
- Group and chunk info, helps with scanability, navigation and memory


--
count: false

- ## Navigation conventions


???

- Consistency: Ever been in a city where street signs are a different color or are in a different location than you expect? Is that delightful or just painful?
- User frustration over conventions/expectations
- @timer 3m / 37

class: center, middle, title
count: false

# Q&A


???

- Not an exhaustive survey of navigation -- more complex nav patterns exist, but should be reserved for truly complex needs -- not just leaned on b/c team or client doesn't want to prioritize nav options for users
- @timer 5m / 42

# Quick navigation test

- ID this site
- What page am I on?
- What are the major sections of this site?
- What are my options at this level?
- Where am I in the scheme of things?
- How can I search?

???
- do 3 of these; @timer 10m / 52

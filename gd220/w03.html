schema.org ... like data attributes for search and other services
like cite attribute, no visual changes

any of the examples not make sense?

# More HTML

## CodePen vs. VS Code

???
- CodePen
  - sketchpad
  - skips markup; don't need body, etc.
  - can check analyze HTML (it's not perfect, tho)
- VS Code
  - for final projects
  - more closely duplicates working enviro
  - allows you to use more files, assets
    - this will be more relevant when you add images to your projects

## Keep markup lowercase

???
- Note that I sometimes ALLCAPS elements when I'm writing about them (in slides or feedback), but this is to make the code stand out from the text and should not be copied over into actual markup.
- Exception: filenames; should match capitalization you see in Finder/Explorer

# More HTML

## Semantic headings

# Intro to CSS

# Intro to CSS

**CSS** stands for

**C**ascading **S**tyle**S**heets

CSS modifies the **appearance** of a web page.


???
- The word "cascading" is pretty poetic and evocative.
- We'll come back to what it means in this context and how it affects us after we cover some other basics.
- CSS defines the design of a web page, determines things like font size, margins, and colors
- Uses a language entirely separate from HTML

# What does it look like?

![example ruleset](img/04_cssruleset1.png)


???
- selector: the thing the styles should be applied to
- declarations: style rules we want to apply to the selector
- many declarations can be made against a single selector


---
count: false

# What does it look like?

![example ruleset](img/04_cssruleset2.png)


???
- each declaration made up of a property and value
- properties are limited by what properties exist in the CSS standard and that are recognized by your current browser
- values are constrained by the property they refer to; 18px, fr'ex, is not an acceptable value for color

# CSS properties: Typography

## `font-size`
## `font-style`
## `font-weight`
## `letter-spacing`
## `line-height`
## `text-align`
## `text-transform`

???
- demo in codepen: https://codepen.io/angeliquejw/pen/eYOrYPK?editors=0100
- font-size: for now, use pixels
- font-style: normal
- other possible font-weight values: normal, lighter; 100-900
- line-height, leave off the unit to make it relative to current font size
- @timer =

# CSS properties: Color

## `background-color`
## `color`
## `keywords`
## `hex`
## `rgb`
## `hsl`
## `opacity`
## `rgb(a)` and `hsl(a)`
## `/* comments */`

???
- demo in codepen: https://codepen.io/angeliquejw/pen/XWrqWyP?editors=0100
- demo of cascade in action
- https://github.com/cdaein/mica-gd220/blob/spring2019/lectures/w2-css-colors.md
- keywords simplest to use, but not very specific and can even vary between browsers
- hue goes from 0 360 (color wheel); saturation and lightness 0 - 100%
- example of why opacity can be crappy

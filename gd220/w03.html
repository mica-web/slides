# Conversations with Robots

> ...design efforts that focus on creating visually effective pages are no longer sufficient to ensure the integrity or accuracy of content published on the web.


???
- if you're responsible for coding designs on the web, it's not enough to be pixel perfect
- even if you're not coding the web site, you can still ask these questions about your projects

# Conversations with Robots

> "You don’t get to decide which platform or device your customers use to access your content: they do." -- Karen McGrane


???
- if you are designing for the web, you are designing for empowered users; to me, this is exciting and awesome
- have you ever been handed something in physical format -- a paper, a brochure, a business card -- and thought, "I'd rather just look this up online" -- you, too, are an empowered web user who designers need to contend with (Amazon brochure)

# Conversations with Robots

> ...providing access to information in a structured, systematic way that is legible to both humans and machines.


???
- not one or the other, but ready for any interface
- smarter search results, including voice
- meaningful
- semantic headings

schema.org ... like data attributes for search and other services
like cite attribute, no visual changes

any of the examples not make sense?

# More HTML

## CodePen vs. VS Code


???
- CodePen
  - sketchpad
  - skips markup; don't need body, etc.
  - can check analyze HTML (it's not perfect, tho)
- VS Code
  - for final projects
  - more closely duplicates working enviro
  - allows you to use more files, assets
    - this will be more relevant when you add CSS today and later when you add images to your projects 
- Before we go further, does anyone have questions about CodePen? We're going to use it some more today, so best to get those out and resolved now.

## Keep markup lowercase


???
- Note that I sometimes ALLCAPS elements when I'm writing about them (in slides or feedback), but this is to make the code stand out from the text and should not be copied over into actual markup.
- Exception: filenames; should match capitalization you see in Finder/Explorer

# Intro to CSS


???
- You'll want to keep CodePen up to follow along with this, just like we did last week with HTML


---

# Intro to CSS

**CSS** stands for

**C**ascading **S**tyle**S**heets

CSS modifies the **appearance** of a web page.


???
- The word "cascading" is pretty poetic and evocative.
- We'll come back to what it means in this context and how it affects us after we cover some other basics.
- CSS defines the design of a web page, determines things like font size, margins, and colors
- Uses a language entirely separate from HTML


---

# What does it look like?

![example ruleset](img/04_cssruleset1.png)


???
- selector: the thing the styles should be applied to
- declarations: style rules we want to apply to the selector
- many declarations can be made against a single selector


---
count: false

# What does it look like?

![example ruleset](img/04_cssruleset2.png)


???
- each declaration made up of a property and value
- properties are limited by what properties exist in the CSS standard and that are recognized by your current browser
- values are constrained by the property they refer to; 18px, fr'ex, is not an acceptable value for color

# What does it look like?

# CSS properties: Typography

## `font-size`
## `font-style`
## `font-weight`
## `letter-spacing`
## `line-height`
## `text-align`
## `text-transform`


???
- demo in codepen: https://codepen.io/angeliquejw/pen/eYOrYPK?editors=0100
- font-size: for now, use pixels
- font-style: normal
- other possible font-weight values: normal, lighter; 100-900
- line-height, leave off the unit to make it relative to current font size
- @timer = 15m/80

# CSS properties: Color

## `background-color`
## `color`
## `keywords`
## `hex`
## `rgb`
## `hsl`
## `opacity`
## `rgb(a)` and `hsl(a)`
## `/* comments */`


???
- demo in codepen: https://codepen.io/angeliquejw/pen/XWrqWyP?editors=0100
- demo of cascade in action
- https://github.com/cdaein/mica-gd220/blob/spring2019/lectures/w2-css-colors.md
- keywords simplest to use, but not very specific and can even vary between browsers
- hue goes from 0 360 (color wheel); saturation and lightness 0 - 100%
- example of why opacity can be crappy
- @timer = 20m/100
- mebbe break for dinner?

# HTML organizational elements


???
- to date, mostly one-to-one elements to content
- `ul`, `ol` exceptions as they aren't visible and wrap list items
- going to explore some more elements that are like that; unlike lists, these elements can hold practically any other HTML elements


--
count: false

## `header`


???
- Describe in your own words
- Can there be more than 1 header per page?


--
count: false

## `footer`


???
- Describe in your own words
- Can there be more than 1 footer per page?


--
count: false

## `main`


???
- dominant content and subject of the page
- unique content; should not include repeated elements like site header, nav or sidebars
- only one `main` per page


--
count: false

## `section`


???
- standalone content
- usually has a heading


--
count: false

## `aside`


???
- indirectly related to main content


--
count: false

## `div`


???
- most generic container element
- consider if there are any other options
- this doesn't mean it needs to be avoided, just that it's generic enough and therefore too easy to default to

--
count: false

## `span`


???
- generic inline container
- add others based on discussion of structural analysis?

# HTML notes

## CodePen

???
- skip unnecessary markup
- can check analyze HTML (it's not perfect, tho)


--
count: false

## Keep markup lowercase

???
- Exception: filenames
- Note that I sometimes ALLCAPS elements when I'm writing about them (in slides or feedback), but this is to make the code stand out from the text and should not be copied over into actual markup.
- Feedback, I often eliminate some things to simplify what we're looking at. (eg of UL)

# HTML5 organizational elements

???
-  to date, mostly one-to-one elements to content
- `ul`, `ol` exceptions as they aren't visible and wrap list items
- going to explore some more elements that are like that; unlike lists, these elements can hold practically any other HTML elements

- Identity structural elements
- Note elements you struggle to label


???
- @timer=3m/53m
- partner up and take 10m to explore some web sites with these elements in mind
  - content-heavy sites vs ones _only_ visual
- what structural elements can you identify?
    - don't look at the markup yet!
- which elements do you struggle to label?
    - check markup: ‚¨ÖÔ∏è make sure everyone knows how to do this
      - agree/disagree?
      - if element is unfamiliar, look it up in MDN
- send me a link via DM in Slack to a site you want to present and discuss
- will post these instructions to the #general channel of Slack
- @timer=10m/63m

# HTML5 organizational elements


???
- We'll dive more deeply into the sites you reviewed in a few, but first: how hard was it to identify the elements that make up the page?
- What made it difficult?
- Did you learn any new HTML elements?


--
count: false

## `header`

???
- Describe in your own words
- Can there be more than 1 header per page?


--
count: false

## `footer`


--
count: false

## `nav`


???
- purpose is to provide navigation LINKS within this document and to other documents; menu, indexes, table of contents
- more than one `nav` per page?
    - site nav/menu, pagination, ToC links like Wikipedia uses


--
count: false

## `main`


???
- dominant content and subject of the page
- unique content; should not include repeated elements like site header, nav or sidebars
- only one `main` per page
- @timer=5m/83m

# Structural analysis, part II

- Recreate the site layout structure using no text, no images
    - Only colors and simple geometric shapes


???
- Using the software of your choice (e.g., InDesign, Illustrator or Sketch), recreate the layout structure of the site you explored
- Express the structure only using simple geometric shapes for the contents (e.g., header with thick black line, body text with thin grey line, image with green rectangular box, etc)
- Do not write any text or use any images
- Send me a DM with a a screenshot of the site you're working from and upload a JPG/PNG/GIF of your version of its layout structure
- https://github.com/cdaein/mica-gd220/blob/spring2019/lectures/w1-structure-analysis.md
- @timer=25m/108m
- take an additional 10-15m to go through examples and discuss
  - what does the site do design-wise to communicate these elements and its hierarchy?
  - what does the abstraction/wireframe make more clear about the site?
- @timer=10-15m/123m
- @break for dinner?

- standalone content
- usually has a heading

## `aside`

???
- indirectly related to main content

--
count: false

## `div`


???
- most generic container element
- consider if there are any other options
- this doesn't mean it needs to be avoided, just that it's generic enough and therefore too easy to default to

--
count: false

## `span`

???
- generic inline container
- add others based on discussion of structural analysis?

# Style tiles


???
Have folks used moodboards in design before? Experiences? Pros? confusing?


--
count: false


![style tiles explained](img/03_styletiles.png)


???
- like a moodboard for web design
- but collage nature of moodboard is more informal
- selection of visual components in a design
- building blocks for complete design
- initial representation of brand feel: old fashioned vs trendy, quirky vs minimal
- iterative without having to do a complete comp, able to dial in

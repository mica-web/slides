- dinner, usually between 6-6:30 each meeting; 60m long
- slides go up to class site within 24hrs of our meeting
    - if I'm late, you totally can ping me in Slack!
- not all assignments are in CANVAS currently, but projects are
tradeoffs:
- working professionally, exp and stories about what's happening in modern web dev
- not immersed at MICA; don't always know what you've already learned or covered (admittedly, different for each of you)
- when I ask questions about that, it's always coming from a place of curiosity, not frustration/expectation or anything else negative
- what you don't know about, I get to teach you about and that's rad

- this is more words than I hope to ever put up on a slide again
- when I ask questions about that, it's always coming from a place of curiosity, not frustration/expectation or anything else negative
- what you don't know about, I get to teach you about and that's rad
- I legitimately feel this way

# Let's do a thing

## Word association

1. At least 4 notes about what you think of when you think of `THE WEB`


???
- other folks will need to read this, so be thoughtful in your handwriting pls
- 5m for each set of notes @timer=10m/60

count: false

1. At least 3 notes about your impressions of `CODING`


???
- 5m for each set of notes @timer=10m/60
- separate each group into positive/negative impressions and discuss @timer=10m/70
- if the web is mostly positive, challenge students to think more critically
- web design: responding to change
    - in the user's browser/expectations
    - in the user's needs
    - in the tech overall
      - if I taught you code the way I learned it in college, would be doing you a disservice
- RE: learning to code
  - builds on itself
    - sometimes this means you'll redo something you did last week
    - this is part of the process and to be expected
    - you can't learn it all in one brain dump
  - has TRUE frustrations: sometimes 1 character actually causes you headaches

# Intro to text editors

- plain text

- plain text vs formatted text (MS Word, Google Docs)

# Intro to text editors

- project/directory view + navigation
--
count: false

- extensible


???
- text editor preferences are something folks feel pretty strongly about in the coding community; VS Code is one of many -- you may have heard of Brackets, Atom, Sublime Text
- we're using VS Code for its plugins and integrations and b/c it works on all systems; everyone using the same thing gives less friction to the learning experience
- having said that, editors are also pretty customizable; the way my VS Code looks won't perfectly match yours
@timer=5m/80

# Your text editor

## Download VS Code

### https://code.visualstudio.com/

# VS Code Extensions

1. **Live Server** by Ritwick Dey
1. **Intellisense for CSS class names in HTML** by Zignd
1. **Path Intellisense** by Christian Kohler
1. **Auto Rename Tag** by Jun Han
1. **Bracket Pair Colorizer** by CoenraadS


???
- in a group/paired up, find your assigned extension and read up about its
- what does the extension do? what problem does it solve?
- discuss how to explain it to your colleagues @timer=10m/105
- presentations on extensions @timer=4*6=24m/130
- install each extension, then reload @timer=10m/140 (dinner?)


---

# Intro to your text editor

So far, we've:

- discussed the benefits of text editors
- downloaded and installed VS Code
- set some basic user preferences
- learned about and installed a handful of extensions


???
Q&A, checkin
- side benefits: I want you to know the WHY of things; I could have just told you to install those extensions and had at it
- that way lies danger and frustration in terms of computers
- this course and coding in general rewards digging into things, learning the why
- not out of laziness that I had you explain things to each other, but b/c I also want you to see each other as resources
- sometimes, when you're struggling with something, you just need another set of eyes or someone to explain something in a different way

count: false

- create folder "**Sites**"

count: false

- create folder "**GD220**"
--
count: false

- "**Open**"


???
- Activity Bar > File Explorer > Open Folder
- in Mac, start in your user directory
- in Win, start in your main drive directory
- create folders and open
- you'll use this same directory for all your projects in this course
@timer=5m/145

# UI walkthrough


???
- file explorer, create file, create folder, drag and drop
- minimap
- search, also search in folder
- source control explorer: we'll spend a lot of time here next week
- debug; ignore at this point
- extensions, already familiar
- settings
- right clicking
- create "index.html"
    - file extension is important; it's what informs/powers that syntax highlighting and autocomplete!

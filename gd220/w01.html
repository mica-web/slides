???
- dinner, usually between 6-6:30 each meeting; 60m long
- slides go up to class site within 24hrs of our meeting
    - if I'm late, you totally can ping me in Slack!
- I don't use CANVAS much: syllabus is up there, assignments and projects will be added, grades and attendance

tradeoffs:
- working professionally, exp and stories about what's happening in modern web dev
- not immersed at MICA; don't always know what you've already learned or covered (admittedly, different for each of you)
- when I ask questions about that, it's always coming from a place of curiosity, not frustration/expectation or anything else negative
- what you don't know about, I get to teach you about and that's rad
- I legitimately feel this way

# Intro to text editors

# Intro to text editors

- project/directory view + navigation
--
count: false

- extensible


???
- text editor preferences are something folks feel pretty strongly about in the coding community; VS Code is one of many -- you may have heard of Brackets, Atom, Sublime Text
- we're using VS Code for its plugins and integrations and b/c it works on all systems; everyone using the same thing gives less friction to the learning experience
- having said that, editors are also pretty customizable; the way my VS Code looks won't perfectly match yours

# Your text editor

1. **Auto Rename Tag** by Jun Han
1. **Bracket Pair Colorizer** by CoenraadS


???
- in a group/paired up, find your assigned extension and read up about its

- discuss how to explain it to your colleagues @timer=10m/90
- presentations on extensions @timer=4*6=24m/114
- install each extension, then reload @timer=10m/124

# Intro to your text editor

So far, we've:

- discussed the benefits of text editors
- downloaded and installed VS Code
- set some basic user preferences
- learned about and installed a handful of extensions


???
Q&A, checkin
- side benefits: I want you to know the WHY of things; I could have just told you to install those extensions and had at it
- that way lies danger and frustration in terms of computers
- this course and coding in general rewards digging into things, learning the why
- not out of laziness that I had you explain things to each other, but b/c I also want you to see each other as resources
- sometimes, when you're struggling with something, you just need another set of eyes or someone to explain something in a different way

![wikipedia definition of wayfinding](img/11_wayfinding.png)

- Wayfinding encompasses all the ways in which people orient themselves and navigate from place to place
- Navigation is the system set up for us, wayfinding is what we/users do in the field or in reality
- Navigation is a crucial part of our web experiences
- Because it's so important, I'm going to go more in depth than is necessary for you to complete project 3 in the hope that this will be helpful to you in the future

- Appears consistently across the site
- Can be removed or hidden, however, to minimize distraction at key points (like when someone is making a purchase or filling out a form)
- May include logo and utility links (e.g., my account, search, cart, etc.)
- @timer 2m / 14

# Icons can be ambiguous

![examples of ambiguous icons](img/11_ambiguous-icons.png)

Even **familiar** icons can be confusing or ambiguous:
- Pencil. Write or edit?
- Plus. Add item or expand?

- x. Close or delete?
- Magnifying glass. Zoom or search?
- Caret. Play, go or slide right?


--
count: false

- Example from: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/wayfinding-for-the-mobile-web/#using-icons

![location markers on a nav menu](img/11_location-marker.png)

???
- Users may not enter on the homepage, navigation is critical to them knowing where they are and finding their way
- Keep in mind that users will miss subtlety here

- background color
- color change
- font weight change

- Q&A about types of nav
- @timer 2m / 36

# Common goals of navigation

## Where am I?

???
- Landmarks to ground the user: site logo, global nav, breadcrumbs, page/section titles


--
count: false

## ...in relation to other things?


--
count: false

## Where can I go?


???
- @timer 2m / 38


---

# Less-obvious functions of navigation

## What's present/possible?


???
By making the hierarchy visible, nav functions like a table of contents -- not just where I can go, but what is encompassed within the site's boundaries


--
count: false

## How do I use this site?


???
- Structure of nav implies where to begin and what order to do things


--
count: false

## How confident am I in the site/its creators?


???
- Clear, approachable nav builds confidence and trust
- @timer 3m / 41


---

# Wayfinding


???
We've talked mostly about what we provide to users--navigation. Let's jump back to the user experience of wayfinding for a few.


--
count: false

## Two types of users

???

- Looking for something in a store with my brother, I'll always be confident I can find a thing, he always looks for someone to ask; these same patterns exist on the web: link-dominant vs search-dominant behaviors; need to consider both

--
count: false

- ### link-dominant
- ### search-dominant


???

- Unlike a store, a web site has no sense of scale vs a store or museum
- No sense of direction
- Little sense of location; no "along the way" placemarkers
- @timer 3m / 44

---

# Additional Considerations

- ## Wording of navigation labels

???
- Think about how terms a user might search for (no one searches for "services," "products")
- Think about topics not formats


--
count: false

- ## Organization of nagivation items


???
- Group and chunk info, helps with scanability, navigation and memory


--
count: false

- ## Navigation conventions


???

- Consistency: Ever been in a city where street signs are a different color or are in a different location than you expect? Is that delightful or just painful?
- User frustration over conventions/expectations
- @timer 3m / 47


---
class: center, middle, title
count: false

# Q&A


???

- Not an exhaustive survey of navigation -- more complex nav patterns exist, but should be reserved for truly complex needs -- not just leaned on b/c team or client doesn't want to prioritize nav options for users
- @timer 5m / 52


---

# Quick navigation test

- ID this site
- What page am I on?
- What are the major sections of this site?
- What are my options at this level?
- Where am I in the scheme of things?
- How can I search?

???
- do 3 of these; @timer 10m / 62

- Slack


???
This is the primary way I will reach out to you outside of class and expect you to be responsive.
Responsive doesn't mean you reply in 10, 30 mins. But within a day or two feels reasonable?
Make sure you are getting Slack notifications, via app or email.

- In-class pushes


???
When we all push a branch and PR to GitHub in class, everyone does that thing.
This prevents you from having issues with your PR outside of class and being unable to resolve them.
Since PRs are what is graded, you must create them in class with everyone else.

# CSS variables


???
First thing's first...


--
count: false

- What's a **variable**?


???
shorthand, alias, nickname


--
count: false

- Why would we use variables?


???
reduce repetition, reduce errors


---

# CSS variables

- What do they look like?

```css
--color-crimson: hsl(360, 90%, 15%);
```


???
- two dashes in front of name
- no spaces in name
- variable name is case sensitive


---
count: false

# CSS variables

## Global

```css
:root {
  --color-crimson: hsl(360, 90%, 15%);
}
```

--
count: false

## Scoped

```css
.your-class {
--color-crimson: hsl(360, 90%, 15%);
}
```


---
count: false

# CSS variables

## Using your variable

.text-smaller[
```css
:root {
  --color-crimson: hsl(360, 90%, 15%);
}
```
]

```css
p {
  color: var(--color-crimson);
}
```


???
replaces traditional value

like CSS classes -- you have to create them in the HTML, then attach styles to them in your stylesheet -- here you have to create and define the variable before you can use it

# CSS variables

## Referencing

.text-smaller[
```css
:root {
  --font-bold: 'NeueAlteGrotesk-Bold', sans-serif;
  --color-crimson: hsl(360, 90%, 15%);
}
```
]

```css
p {
  color: var(--color-crimson);
  font-family: var(--font-bold);
}
```


???
My examples were all around color and this or font names is how I recommend starting to use varibles, but they are not limited to these things!

Limitations: Can only be used as property values NOT property names

# Web Style Guide on Images

![screenshot of reading](img/07_reading.png)


???
anyone remember this reading?
bit lengthy, but let's dive into 3 specific bits: image types, image formats and image size


---

# Image types

- raster _vs._ vector


???
raster, fine grid of pixels; used for photos, artwork
vector, mathematical; used for diagrams, charts, icons


--
count: false

# Image formats

- GIF
- JPG
- PNG


???
What do they have in common? (raster)
When to use which?
- GIF
  - pros: animated, flat expanses of a single color field, can remove colors not in use
  - cons: weak concept of transparency (based on single color, not area), shading/gradients/photography (256 colors)
    - interlaced vs non-interlaced?
- JPG
    - pros: great for photos (16.8m colors)
    - cons: lossy, no transparency
- PNG
    - pros: designed for the web, sophisticated transparency
    - cons: lossless (yay data, boo file size)

- SVG


???
- SVG
  - pros: scaleable, transparency, works simply on retina and other displays
  - cons: more complicated to integrate, more choices, accessibility (no `alt` text)

# Image size

- width + height
- resolution
- file size


???
- resize images to be a reasonable width relative to your layout
  - for proj 2, max-width of 640px so no reason for any images to be wider than that
- resolution; generally a nonissue, but can set it 96ppi if you're just looking for an answer
- file size, the most important
    - even after "save/export for web" use additional compression tools
    - aim for 100k or lower

@timer 5m / 40

# Project 1 Images: Originals

![proj 1 image file sizes](img/07_p1-filesize.png)


???
top 5 largest images from project 1; largest over 7mb and nearly 5k pixel wide


---

# Project 1 Images: Resized

![proj 1 images resized](img/07_p1-resized.png)


???
resized each to 600px wide and ran through compressor
only one still over limit (sneaky, 107.6kb, but still a 95%-plus decrease from the original)

count: false

- Be useful
- Be brief (~50 char)

count: false

1. `Add new font files`
1. `Make header responsive`
1. `Fix typo`


???
- useful = what does this change?
- brief and starts with a verb in the present tense, like giving a command
- does **not** need to mention which file you worked on

# Best practices for commit messages


- **not** `Thursday's work`


???
- why is this less than ideal?
> A commit is not a reference to a working period (e.g., "Friday's work") because you would never want to undo a whole day; you'd much more likely want to undo discrete bits of that day's work
- commit represents a task or chunk of work that is somehow connected
- common issue for new git users is to get lost in the work and forget to commit; this muddies the water and makes it harder to understand your changes, your intent and definitely impacts your ability to undo things
- if it helps, write out a task list _before_ you start working/coding; each one of those tasks could be a commit
- @timer=3m/106

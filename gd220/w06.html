# First things first

1. Add style tiles and designs to Google Drive
.text-smaller[
  - `assignments > proj2 > your_first_name`
- must be in PDF, PNG or JPG
]
2. Read visual hierarchy article
3. Figure out what you want to say about your designs to provide context for critique, ~2-3mins
4. Review each of your colleagues' designs


???
https://99designs.com/blog/tips/6-principles-of-visual-hierarchy/
Think, specifically, about how to apply these principles to your existing designs and in your critiques

# Our agreements

1. Be present and undistracted
1. Listen before speaking
1. Ask questions, don't rely only on statements
1. Know the **WHY**


???
- When _giving_ feedback, remember to focus on the problem and the why, not providing a solution
- When _receiving_ feedback, remember to listen to your body -- know if/when you're getting defensive -- and that you should go into this **expect** to get critical feedback -- everyone here has room to grow and learn

presentations & critiques 9 x 10 = @timer 90m / 117
break for dinner?

# Box model


???
- last week we talked about the box model: that each HTML element is a rectangle that is influenced by its margins, border, padding and content size
- keep this in mind as we move on to coding layouts

# Box model

???
- layouts are built out of these same blocks

# CSS Layout


???
Let's move on to learning the CSS to handle multiple components and how they relate to each other

count: false

- `display`
- `position`
- `z-index`


???
@timer = 5m

???
- display
    - block
      - takes up 100% of its parent element unless that's overridden in some other way
      - they are laid out on their own line
    - inline
      - only takes up as much space as its content, padding and border need
      - width and height calculated by browsers based on content; you can not declare a height and width on an inline element
    - inline-block
      - like above, but with more control
      - can declare height, width, margins, padding

    @timer = 10m / 15

- position
    - static (default)
    - relative to its normal position
    - absolute
    - containers
    - example: https://codepen.io/angeliquejw/pen/bZbEvP?editors=1100
    @timer = 10m / 25

# Try it


???
- start here: https://codepen.io/angeliquejw/pen/a75364461e08496b5a1750f5fb77de89?editors=1100
- solution: https://codepen.io/angeliquejw/pen/b536d0410e38e54052f883363d8fa503?editors=1100
@timer = 20m / 45


---

???
- z-index
    - Use example 5 above
    - @timer = 5m / 50

- avoid float now if anything else will work
- and remember to use clearfix if you use floats
- @timer = 5m / 55
- explicit vs relative sizing
- vertical-align
- @timer = 10m / 65
- min- and max- height and width
- vh, vw
- @timer = 10m / 75

# Troubleshooting CSS

# Remainder of class

.text-smaller[
- Work on markup for your card
- Start styles for card

???
- Other than `html`, `body`, `*` everything should have a classname?

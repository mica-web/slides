# Radical Candor


???
- book about building teams called radical candor
- RC != brutal honesty
- Requires that care first and care enough to give folks direct feedback
- b/c this is a classroom environment, I cannot force you to care about one another's development and progression, but know that I'm treating you as members of my team and, at the very least, my feedback is rooted in caring
- as such, I go into critiques expecting them to be a teambuilding exercise, not about tearing anyone down; feedback, to me, is a form of collaboration

# Responsibilities when giving feedback


???
- has its own responsibilities; and not just in a "do unto others as you would have done unto you" sort of way


--
count: false

- Understand the context
- Communicate the **WHY**


???

- understand the context and audience that is being designed for; you may not be in that audience, so be prepared to check your personal preferences
- not about what you like or do not; your favorite colors don't play into this at all
- figure out the _why_ before you share your feedback
- make statements about what's effective and _why_


--
count: false

- Be descriptive about any problems _without_ being prescriptive about the solution

# Responsibilities when receiving feedback

- Learn your tell
- Set your expectations
- Ownership


???
- learn what you, personally, do when you are feeling defensive
- spot that and squash it
- going to forever be getting feedback on your work, recommend learning how to be receptive to feedback as early as possible
- don't go into a critique or feedback session expecting to walk out without actionable feedback; you're in school, you're here to learn and shouldn't be setting yourself up with the expectations of knocking something out of the park in a first draft
- have your own questions, own the things you are strugging with or uncertain about (but don't lead with them)
- you own the design, you own the process and will make the final call about what feedback to respond to and attempt to resolve

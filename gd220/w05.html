# On Critiques


???
- Definitely don't have perspective of how things are done in other GD classes
- Bringing perspective of how we handle feedback on my team
- How we treat each other, how we treat each other's ideas


---

# Radical Candor

.center[![radical candor grid](img/05_radical-candor.png)]

???
- book about building teams called radical candor
- RC != brutal honesty
- Requires that care first and care enough to give folks direct feedback
- b/c this is a classroom environment, I cannot force you to care about one another's development and progression, but know that I'm treating you as members of my team and, at the very least, my feedback is rooted in caring
- as such, I go into critiques expecting them to be a teambuilding exercise, not about tearing anyone down; feedback, to me, is a form of collaboration

# Your Responsibilities 

## Giving feedback


???
- has its own responsibilities; and not just in a "do unto others as you would have done unto you" sort of way


--
count: false

- Understand the context
- Communicate the **WHY**


???

- understand the context and audience that is being designed for; you may not be in that audience, so be prepared to check your personal preferences
- not about what you like or do not; your favorite colors don't play into this at all
- figure out the _why_ before you share your feedback
- make statements about what's effective and _why_


--
count: false

- Be **descriptive** about any problems _without_ being **prescriptive** about the solution


???
- Discuss with examples
- Folks must specifically ask for prescriptive feedback ("Do you have any suggestions about how I could solve that issue?")
- I will cut you off if you head in this direction; I won't like it, but I'll do it.


---

# Your Responsibilities

## Receiving feedback

- Learn your tell
- Set your expectations
- Ownership


???
- learn what you, personally, do when you are feeling defensive
- spot that and squash it
- going to forever be getting feedback on your work, recommend learning how to be receptive to feedback as early as possible
- don't go into a critique or feedback session expecting to walk out without actionable feedback; you're in school, you're here to learn and shouldn't be setting yourself up with the expectations of knocking something out of the park in a first draft
- have your own questions, own the things you are strugging with or uncertain about (but don't lead with them)
- you own the design, you own the process and will make the final call about what feedback to respond to and attempt to resolve


---

# During presentations + critiques

## Shared understanding + agreements

1. Be present and undistracted
1. Listen before speaking
1. Ask questions, don't rely only on statements
1. Know the **WHY**


???
- For all involved: giving and receiving feedback
- Students read each one and interpret
- questions or objections?
- @timer=
- X critiques @ 8m each = @timer 
- @break = 10m/

# Process / Workflow

## Waterfall

# Waterfall

.center[![relay race handing off baton](img/05_relay.jpg)]


???

This process is described as "waterfall" -- but I think of it more like a relay race where folks do their bit, then pass the baton/project off to the next stage.


---

# Process / Workflow

.center[![waterfall workflow](img/05_waterfall.png)]

## Waterfall

???

## Issues:

- v lengthy process
- so much can change from the start of the project to the completion: staff, design ideas, priorities
- b/c designers and developers not working together, often results in static design assets
- not responsive
- don't show interaction and animation
- often don't use real(istic) content
- process doesn't make as much sense when you're working on a web product vs web site or in an agency
- talk about the difference between a web site and a web product


---

# So what else?


???
- Faster, more collaborative approach called agile
- Agile manifesto sounds intimidating, but in practice it's not all that

# Process / Workflow

.center[![agile workflow](img/05_agile.png)]

## Agile


???
Obviously not the only way to go about this. Enter "agile."

- Two-week sprints
- Learn fast and iterate (ie, make changes/adapt).
- Highly collaborative

## Style tiles


???
Have folks used moodboards in design before? Experiences? Pros? confusing?


--
count: false


![style tiles explained](img/03_styletiles.png)


???
- like a moodboard for web design
- but collage nature of moodboard is more informal
- selection of visual components in a design
- building blocks for complete design
- initial representation of brand feel: old fashioned vs trendy, quirky vs minimal
- iterative without having to do a complete comp, able to dial in

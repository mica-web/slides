# 4 things
### to consider & work on

### code review & assistance

# Thing #1: `q` _vs._ `blockquote` _vs._ pull quote


--
count: false

## `q`


???
used for an inline quote

--
count: false

```html
<p><q>“It suggests the octopus is carrying these tools around because it has some understanding they may be useful in the future,”</q> said <cite>Mr. Amodio, a graduate student studying animal intelligence at the University of Cambridge in Britain</cite>.</p>
```

???
- quote stays in the flow of the p tag; inline
- nice to have, but you'll see it's pretty optional and not commonly used

---
# Thing #1: `q` _vs._ `blockquote` _vs._ pull quote

## `q`
## `blockquote`


???
An _extended_ quotation, usually indented or set aside from the body


--
count: false

.text-smaller[
```html
<p>One is known as the ecological intelligence hypothesis. It holds that intelligence evolves as an adaptation for finding food. While some animals have a reliable food supply, others have to cope with unpredictability.</p>

<blockquote><p>“If you eat fruit, you have to remember where the fruiting trees are and when they’re ripe,” said <cite>Mr. Amadio</cite>. “It can be much more cognitively challenging than eating leaves.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Tools allow animals to get to food that they couldn’t reach otherwise. And if they can make plans for the future, they can store food to survive hard times.</p>
```

# Thing #1: `q` _vs._ `blockquote` _vs._ pull quote

## `blockquote`

![blockquote example](img/05_blockquote.png)
### https://cdpn.io/pen/pGGRar


---
count: false

# Thing #1: `q` _vs._ `blockquote` _vs._ pull quote

## `q`
## `blockquote`
## pull quote

???
- q and blockquote are both HTML elements; pull quote is not
- block quotation and pull quote are _also_ graphic design concepts
- a blockquote is in the flow of the document and usually set off by indenting
- a pull quote is lifted from the flow of the document to highlight a concept or otherwise be a lure for the reader
- the original quote is still in the flow of the document and the pull quote may be abbreviated

---
count: false

# Thing #1: Pull quote examples

![an example pull quote](img/05_pullquote1.png)

???
- Simplest design wise
- But also a bit confusing b/c it's laid out more like a blockquote, but as you can see from the highlight, it is actually pulling a quote from earlier in the text
- Also, it's not actually a quote from a source -- it's quoting the article author


---
count: false

# Thing #1: Pull quote examples

![an example pull quote](img/05_pullquote2.png)

count: false

# Thing #1: Pull quote examples

![an example pull quote](img/05_pullquote3.png)


???
- Since pull quote _isn't_ an HTML element, how should we mark it up?

---
count: false

# Thing #1: Pull quote markup

```html
<aside>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There's a big part of me that's like, would I have made it in this career if I had student loans?</p>
  </blockquote>
</aside>
```

???
- aside is a hint that this isn't necessary to the main content
- blockquote
- optional p tag

---
count: false

# Thing #1: Pull quote markup

```html
<aside>
  <blockquote>There's a big part of me that's like, would I have made it in this career if I had student loans?</blockquote>
</aside>
```

???
- Why use the extra markup?
- If you have styles on your p element that you want to also use for your blockquote, this saves you repeating those styles or dealing with conflicts


---
# Thing #2: Specifying fonts


--
count: false

- `font-size`
- `font-style`
- `font-weight`


???
Already discussed last week; font size is the most obvious, font style controls if the font should be normal or italic; font weight controls how bold or thin the font displays

--
count: false

- `font-family`

--
count: false

# Thing #2: Specifying fonts

- `font-size`
- `font-style`
- `font-weight`
- `font-family`
  - font stacks
  - web fonts: https://fonts.google.com/

# Thing #3: `i` vs. `em` vs. `b` vs. `strong`

### `i`

???
- set off from the text for some reason:
  - technical terms
  - foreign language phrases
  - fictional character's thoughts


---
count: false

# Thing #3: `i` vs. `em` & `b` vs. `strong`

### `i` vs. `em`


???
- em is for stress emphasis


---
count: false

# Thing #3: `i` vs. `em` & `b` vs. `strong`

### `b`


???
- text you want to draw attention to but doesn't have the importance of, say, a heading tag
- keywords, first sentence (lede) in an article, product names


---
count: false

# Thing #3: `i` vs. `em` & `b` vs. `strong`

### `b` vs `strong`


???
- strong importance, seriousness, or urgency for its contents
- none of these should be used just because you want the text to be bold or italic; we'll discuss how to do that with span elements and CSS going forward
- you should always be able to point to the WHY when you use any of these 4 elements


---
count: false

# Thing #3: Solve for `X`

### Example #1

```html
Dinosaurs <X>eat</X> man...woman inherits the earth.
```

![Ellie Sattler in Jurassic Park](img/05_jp1.gif)


???
`em` : represents stress emphasis on the content


---
count: false

# Thing #3: Solve for `X`

### Example #2

```html
<X>Lex Murphy:</X> It's a UNIX system, I know this!
```

![Lex Murphy in Jurassic Park](img/05_jp2.jpg)


???
`b` : represents character name in dialog


---
count: false

# Thing #3: Solve for `X`

### Example #3

```html
You see a <X>Tyrannosaur</X> doesn't follow a set pattern or park schedules, the essence of chaos.
```

![Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park](img/05_jp3.png)


???
`i` : represents scientific name


---
count: false

# Thing #3: Solve for `X`

### Example #4

```html
Shoot her! <X>SHOOT HER!!</X>
```

![Jurassic Park velociraptor](img/05_jp4.webp)


???
`strong` : represents seriousness, urgency


---

# Thing #4: Consistent color values

```css
h1 {
  color: #B11C00;
}
h2 {
  color: rgb(177, 28, 0);
}
h3 {
  color: hsl(9.5, 100%, 34.7%);
}
```

---
count: false

# Thing #4: Consistent color values

![they're all the same color, yo](img/05_color-values.png)


???
If you use an assortment of color values, it becomes very difficult to tell when a color is repeated or reused or which color is which. We'll delve into this more later today.


---
class: center, middle, title

# More about CSS


???
- Organizing your CSS + the cascade
- use comments to make the structure of your CSS clear
- alphabetize your properties
- makes it easy to catch duplication and know what you've already written
- not as crucial when you only have two properties, but much more so the more CSS you write


---

# Naming things in css

https://mica-web.github.io/gd-220/hints/naming-classes


???
- Multiple selectors and classnames
- Naming things
- Box model: margin, padding, height, width, box-sizing
- Troubleshooting CSS
  - relative/absolute links

---

# Rubric

???
- For this assignment, will only get "in development" mark on HTML and CSS if you fail to correct something I have already pointed out in your code review
- This, unfortunately, cannot apply to you if you did not give me a PR checkin to review this weekend

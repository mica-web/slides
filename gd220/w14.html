This is why I've dialed in and commented on overuse of DIVs or misusing heading elements

Using headings semantically, H1, H2, H3 creates a readable and useful table of contents for screenreaders

# What else should we think about when we think about accessibility?


???
So far, we've considered and discussed how our choices might improve or hinder how folks with a vision impairment -- from color blindness to true blindness -- experience a web site and talked about folks using keyboard navigation, which could be related to a mobility impairment or be out of personal preference.

This, in my mind, is a very narrow scope and expectation about what it means to make the information and experiences of the  web accessibile.

# Inclusive Design

![Microsoft inclusive design toolkit](img/14_inclusive-design.png)


???
Let's expand the parameters of the convo together
- 15m to read, make notes about anything that surprises you/feels new/like an A HA or any examples you can come up with related to the reading
- Discuss reading and examples

# Designing inclusively

???
  - smaller requires more accuracy, forces user to change their finger position
  - target is hidden when we touch it
  - time to hit target is longer if target is smaller

# Workflow


???
accessibility is an attribute, while inclusive design is a method


Accessibility, not sprinkled on, not added on later; not nice to have
Don't assume someone else owns this or is thinking about this
Needs to be baked into the process


Every decision we make can raise or lower barriers to participation in society.


ADA Lawsuits
- Beyonce 2019
- Apple 2018 -- "engaged in acts of intentional discrimination" by not being fully accessible to blind or visually-impaired consumers
- Hulu 2016 by Natl Assoc of the Deaf for lack of closed captions

But, legit, we shouldn't do good out of fear

As designers, you can endeavor to make things pretty
Or you can do so much more

Elevators, curb cuts, Braille


- ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
- https://lkopacz.github.io/aria-presentation/
- https://benrobertson.io/accessibility/principles-getting-started-website-accessibility#principle-4-talk-to-your-computer
- Web Content And Accessibility Guides 2.0, or WCAG 2.0 for short
- 4 main tenets: POUR - Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust
- perceivable means different stress cases don't stop users from reading, watching, or listening to your content
- operable, which means different stress cases don't keep users from getting to all the pages and filling out the forms
- Stress cases don't prevent users from understanding the sites' intended meaning
- Robust basically means stress cases don't prevent users from accessing the content from a wide variety of devices

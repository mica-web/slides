- color contrast
- don't use just color to make critical info understandable
- avoid red/green and blue/yellow combinations
- be super thoughtful about text in light grey
- focus states
- don't undo them
- keep labels, not replaced by placeholders
- alt text
- keyboard navigation
- There are over 56 million people in the United States (nearly 1 in 5) and over 1 billion people worldwide who have a disability.

- accessibility is
- performance
- your site working in multiple browers
- understandable language
- temporary impairments
- situational impairments
- designed for touch, keyboards
  - 44x44 px per Apple guidelines
  - 45-57px square per MIT Touch Lab; 72px for thumb
    - https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/finger-friendly-design-ideal-mobile-touchscreen-target-sizes/
  - smaller requires more accuracy, forces user to change their finger position
  - target is hidden when we touch it
  - time to hit target is longer if target is smaller
- typography
  - body font size at least 14-20px
  - don't underline text that isn't a link

Accessibility, not sprinkled on, not added on later; not nice to have
Don't assume someone else owns this or is thinking about this
Needs to be baked into the process

ADA Lawsuits
- Beyonce 2019
- Apple 2018 -- "engaged in acts of intentional discrimination" by not being fully accessible to blind or visually-impaired consumers
- Hulu 2016 by Natl Assoc of the Deaf for lack of closed captions

But, legit, we shouldn't do good out of fear

As designers, you can endeavor to make things pretty
Or you can do so much more

inclusive design


Designing for inclusivity not only opens up our products and services to more people, it also reflects how people really are. All humans grow and adapt to the world around them and we want our designs to reflect that.

Every decision we make can raise or lower barriers to participation in society.

accessibility is an attribute, while inclusive design is a method

mismatches between individuals and their environments, situations, and society as a whole


Elevators, curb cuts, Braille

- Inclusive Design manual from Microsoft
- 12m to read, make notes about anything that surprises you/feels new/like an A HA or any examples you can come up with related to the reading

- ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
- https://lkopacz.github.io/aria-presentation/
- https://benrobertson.io/accessibility/principles-getting-started-website-accessibility#principle-4-talk-to-your-computer
- Web Content And Accessibility Guides 2.0, or WCAG 2.0 for short
- 4 main tenets: POUR - Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust
- perceivable means different stress cases don't stop users from reading, watching, or listening to your content
- operable, which means different stress cases don't keep users from getting to all the pages and filling out the forms
- Stress cases don't prevent users from understanding the sites' intended meaning
- Robust basically means stress cases don't prevent users from accessing the content from a wide variety of devices

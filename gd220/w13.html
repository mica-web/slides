- `alt` text

???
What makes good `alt` text?

# Accessible by Default

## Be ASAP

### As
### Semantic
### As
### Possible


???
This is why I've dialed in and commented on overuse of DIVs or misusing heading elements


---

# Accessible by Default

## Headings

Using headings semantically, H1, H2, H3 creates a readable and useful table of contents for screenreaders

# Use labels on forms

outline: 0;

Used to be common to see this, don't do this

# What else should we think about when we think about accessibility?


???
So far, we've considered and discussed how our choices might improve or hinder how folks with a vision impairment -- from color blindness to true blindness -- experience a web site and talked about folks using keyboard navigation, which could be related to a mobility impairment or be out of personal preference.

This, in my mind, is a very narrow scope and expectation about what it means to make the information and experiences of the  web accessibile.

# Inclusive Design

![Microsoft inclusive design toolkit](img/14_inclusive-design.png)


???
Let's expand the parameters of the convo together
- 15m to read, make notes about anything that surprises you/feels new/like an A HA or any examples you can come up with related to the reading
- Discuss reading and examples


---

# Designing inclusively

- thinking of impairments as permanent _and_ situational _and_ temporary


---
count: false

# Designing inclusively

# Designing inclusively

# Designing for touch


???
- 44x44px per Apple guidelines
- 45-57px square per MIT Touch Lab; 72px for thumb

![touch guidelines examle](img/14_touch-target-57.jpg)


???
  - smaller requires more accuracy, forces user to change their finger position
  - target is hidden when we touch it
  - time to hit target is longer if target is smaller

# Workflow

## Don't assume someone is thinking about accessibility of your web projects

### Be that person


???
accessibility is an attribute, while inclusive design is a method


Accessibility, not sprinkled on, not added on later; not nice to have
Needs to be baked into the process


Every decision we make can raise or lower barriers to participation in society.

ADA Lawsuits (Americans with Disablities Act, 1990 civil rights law)

# ADA + WCAG

## Web Content and Accessibility Guides


???
- Web Content And Accessibility Guides 2.0, or WCAG 2.0 for short


--
count: false

- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust


???
- 4 main tenets: POUR - Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust
- perceivable means different stress cases don't stop users from reading, watching, or listening to your content
- operable, which means different stress cases don't keep users from getting to all the pages and filling out the forms
- Stress cases don't prevent users from understanding the sites' intended meaning
- Robust basically means stress cases don't prevent users from accessing the content from a wide variety of devices

But, legit, we shouldn't do good out of fear

Elevators, curb cuts, Braille

As designers, you can endeavor to make things pretty
Or you can do so much more

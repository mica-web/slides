# Agenda

1. Git + GitHub in Plain English
1. Understanding git
1. VS Code + git + GitHub
1. Critiques + feedback
1. Getting started with CSS
1. Next steps

???
- first 2hrs all about git: we'll talk about the reading, I'll talk a bit about some basic git concepts and then we'll walkthrough getting github setup
- after dinner: critiques and feedback on style tiles and designs for proj1, then some intro to CSS

---
# Reading

### Git and GitHub in Plain English


???
- https://blog.red-badger.com/2016/11/29/gitgithub-in-plain-english
- quotes
- comments/insights
- questions (last, as they will impact what we do next)

- @timer=10m
- temperature check: how well do folks feel like they understand git at this point?

# Benefits of git


???
- what do you think the benefits of git are for you, not generically?
- any examples you can think of and share where git might have saved you?
- @timer=5m/15
- reading used an author, but that's obviously  not the common or only use case

# Benefits of git

???
- one of the reasons I'm keen to use git + GitHub here is for code review.
- examples of code review from last semester

# Benefits of git

![code review](img/02_git_help2.png)


???
- w/o GH, I just have to send you a doc and make comments like "on line 33, you xyz"...but, line 33 may be different for you locally vs the code I'm reviewing if you've made changes :(
- so, while getting new dev environments set up is difficult, stressful and a rough way to start a course, I really really believe it will be worthwhile for all of us

# Intro to git

# Before git

.center[![empty directory](img/02_git2.png)]


???
We have a directory of our project files: multiple files, can even include other directories. In no way limited by file type.


---
class: center, middle, title

# `git init`


???
- `init` is short for "initialize"
- the `git init` command says "This directory is now a git repo, git commands should work in here and maintain a record of changes"


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add1.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center
count: false

## `git init`


???
- `init` also gives us some git concepts: working directory, staging area and repo
- these are all **CONCEPTS**, not actual folders
- not about creating v1, v2, v3 of a file -- but identifying and knowing how git is tracking things
- working directory: where git is initialized, where you do your work
- there are commands to activate the other 2 concepts (staging and repo), so let's dig into those next
- @timer=5m/25


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add1.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center

## `git add`

???
- there are commands to activate the other 2 concepts (staging and repo), so let's dig into those next
- `git add` activates the **staging area**
- staging area: a holding cell for files you're going to add to your repo


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add2.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center
count: false

## `git add`


???
- can move a single file over


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add3.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center
count: false

## `git add`


???
- or several/all
- you do this every time you want to add your changes to the repo
- changes are still in this middle zone, not yet attached to the project repo
- we do that via `git commit`
- @timer=5m/30


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_commit.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center

## `git commit`


???
- we do that via `git commit`
- a **commit** applies all the changes in your staging area to the local repository and to the history of the project
- **repo**: git's current version of your project
- a commit is not the same as a save
- save is to your working directory, always local
- we'll talk more in detail about commits shortly, but for now the important distinction is that a commit is to your project history, a save is to your working directory
- if it's helpful, think of your code like prepping a care package:

  -working directory: you have some things in the house for the package, you may have things you bought
  - add/staging is the prep before you mail the package, gathering up all the things that are going to go in your envelope or box
  - a commit is actually mailing the thing
- while you can see a commit as the conclusion to a narrative, it's not that final: you can still send further letters/packages!

- gitlab, bitbucket other services that also use git in similar ways
- This really isn't important for you right now, but since we're only working in GitHub, I want to make it clear that you have other options down the road
- @timer=5m/45

# Getting started with git

## Open the terminal in VS Code

--

.text-larger[
  ```
  Ctrl  `
  ```
]


???
- with VS Code open, press control and backtick to make the terminal visible
- backtick is character on the tilda key
- please do **not** work ahead during this section
- not something I'd normally request
- I know it can be frustrating to wait while I troubleshoot someone else's issue, but getting ahead of yourself here and/or assuming you know what I want you to do next will only cause frustration

---

# Getting started with git


???
- most of what we'll do w/ git in VS Code can be done via the GUI vs command line, but a handful of commands we're going to use today will require command line/terminal


--
count: false

- `git --version`


???
- asking your computer if it knows about the command "git" and, if so, what version is installed

# git + VS Code

- Open up your course projects directory


???
- `Sites/GD2` or `Sites/GD220`
- Should only have a mostly blank `index.html` file

--
count: false

- In the terminal:

`git status`


???
- Even though you just installed git, this should still deliver an error because we haven't told git about this directory.
- Also, this is the 2nd time I knowingly had you use a command that gave you an error -- this may feel like I'm setting you up for failure, but that's not the intention. Errors are a very normal part of web development and we can LEARN from them.
- It's important to build up the muscle of treating errors like information, not the end of the line.

--
count: false

- Open Source Control explorer


???
- `git init` via UI
- now this sidebar acts like `git status`
- add `index.html` and make first commit
- only a local copy of your code and its changes, which is good, but of limited help -- both for code review and cloud backups

1. in the browser, go to GitHub and log in
1. create a new GH repo

### `git config --global user.email "aweger@mica.edu"`


???
- Doesn't have to be the email you signed up for GH with, but it's easier if it is. If you opt to use a different email address, put up a post-it.
- you can also verify these things by doing `git config user.email`
- put up a post-it note when you're done and verified!

# Best practices for commits


--
count: false

- Be useful
- Be brief (~50 char)


--
count: false

1. `Add new font files`
1. `Make header responsive`
1. `Fix typo`


???
- useful = what does this change?
- brief and starts with a verb in the present tense, like giving a command
- does **not** need to mention which file you worked on
- @timer=5m/85


---
count: false

# Best practices for commit messages


- **not** `Thursday's work`


???
- why is this less than ideal?
> A commit is not a reference to a working period (e.g., "Friday's work") because you would never want to undo a whole day; you'd much more likely want to undo discrete bits of that day's work
- commit represents a task or chunk of work that is somehow connected
- common issue for new git users is to get lost in the work and forget to commit; this muddies the water and makes it harder to understand your changes, your intent and definitely impacts your ability to undo things
- if it helps, write out a task list _before_ you start working/coding; each one of those tasks could be a commit

# git branches


???
- when we created our repo, GH gave us a default branch, which is titled "master"


--
count: false

???
- any commits we've added to date, have gone to this master branch


---
count: false

# Git branches

.center[![creating a branch in git](img/02_branch3.png)]


???
- this is one way to go -- but it's less than ideal:
    - master is considered the authoritative source / production code
    - while I can look at your commits to master, it's not the best way to handle code review
- @timer=5m/100


---
count: false

# Git branches


???
- let's explore another way
- we use branches to isolate our work, especially when working on teams, and, in this course, to get feedback on things via pull requests (which is a request to have your branch be integrated or merged into the master branch)


---
count: false

# Git branches

.center[![creating a branch in git](img/02_branch4a.png)]


???
- creating a new branch is like using "File save as..." on a document; it takes the current state of your repo and creates a duplicate of it


---

# Git branches

- we do this via a process called merging

# Git branches in VS Code

.center[![branches in VS Code UI](img/02_branch-master.png)]

- in VS Code, you can see what branch you're working on in the the status bar, on the far left
- and can create new branches via UI
- branch names cannot have spaces in them

# Q&A for branches & workflow


???

    - before: actually go through the process of creating proj1 branch
    - after:  @break for dinner?

# While you're waiting

Add your style tiles and mockups into the class Google Drive
  - `assignments` > `proj1`
  - look for the folder with your first initial + your lastname


???
Ask students to rename each file to start with a number and an underscore, followed by the current filename to make it easier to go through the files in the correct order.

--
count: false

1. Be present and undistracted
1. Listen before speaking
1. Ask questions, don't rely only on statements
1. Know the **WHY**


???
- For all involved: giving and receiving feedback
- Students read each one and interpret


---
class: center, middle, title

# Radical Candor


???
- book about building teams called radical candor
- RC != brutal honesty
- Requires that care first and care enough to give folks direct feedback
- b/c this is a classroom environment, I cannot force you to care about one another's development and progression, but know that I'm treating you as members of my team and, at the very least, my feedback is rooted in caring
- as such, I go into critiques expecting them to be a teambuilding exercise, not about tearing anyone down; feedback, to me, is a form of collaboration


---

# Responsibilities when giving feedback


???
- has its own responsibilities; and not just in a "do unto others as you would have done unto you" sort of way


--
count: false

- Understand the context
- Communicate the **WHY**


???

- understand the context and audience that is being designed for; you may not be in that audience, so be prepared to check your personal preferences
- not about what you like or do not; your favorite colors don't play into this at all
- figure out the _why_ before you share your feedback
- make statements about what's effective and _why_


--
count: false

- Be descriptive about any problems _without_ being prescriptive about the solution


---

# Responsibilities when receiving feedback

- Learn your tell
- Set your expectations
- Ownership


???
- learn what you, personally, do when you are feeling defensive
- spot that and squash it
- going to forever be getting feedback on your work, recommend learning how to be receptive to feedback as early as possible
- don't go into a critique or feedback session expecting to walk out without actionable feedback; you're in school, you're here to learn and shouldn't be setting yourself up with the expectations of knocking something out of the park in a first draft
- have your own questions, own the things you are strugging with or uncertain about (but don't lead with them)
- you own the design, you own the process and will make the final call about what feedback to respond to and attempt to resolve


---

# On Critiques

## Shared understanding + agreement

1. Be present and undistracted
1. Listen before speaking
1. Ask questions, don't rely only on statements
1. Know the **WHY**

# Intro to CSS

# Intro to CSS

**CSS** stands for

**C**ascading **S**tyle**S**heets

CSS modifies the **appearance** of a web page.


???
- The word "cascading" is pretty poetic and evocative.
- We'll come back to what it means in this context and how it affects us after we cover some other basics.


---

# What does it look like?

![example ruleset](img/04_cssruleset1.png)


???
- selector: the thing the styles should be applied to
- declarations: style rules we want to apply to the selector
- In discussing HTML vs programming languages, one of the ways it was described as "declarative."
- As you might already see, CSS is also pretty declarative.


---
count: false

# What does it look like?

![example ruleset](img/04_cssruleset2.png)


???
- each declaration made up of a property and value
- properties are limited by what properties exist in the CSS standard and that are recognized by your current browser
- values are constrained by the property they refer to; 18px, fr'ex, is not an acceptable value for color
- many declarations can be made against a single selector

---

- demo in codepen
- font-size: for now, use pixels
- font-style: normal
- other possible font-weight values: normal, lighter; 100-900
- line-height, leave off the unit to make it relative to current font size

# CSS properties: Color

## `color`
## `background-color`

## `hex`
## `keywords`
## `opacity`

???
- https://github.com/cdaein/mica-gd220/blob/spring2019/lectures/w2-css-colors.md
- keywords simplest to use, but not very specific and can even vary between browsers
- hue goes from 0 360 (color wheel); saturation and lightness 0 - 100%
- example of why opacity can be crappy

# Q&A


???
What questions or issues did you encounter in adding CSS to your project?


---
# CSS + Fonts


--
count: false

- `font-size`
- `font-style`
- `font-weight`


???
Already discussed last week; font size is the most obvious, font style controls if the font should be normal or italic; font weight controls how bold or thin the font displays


--
count: false

- `font-family`

count: false

# Blockquote


???
An _extended_ quotation, usually indented or set aside from the body

```html
<p>One is known as the ecological intelligence hypothesis. It holds that intelligence evolves as an adaptation for finding food. While some animals have a reliable food supply, others have to cope with unpredictability.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you eat fruit, you have to remember where the fruiting trees are and when they’re ripe,” said <cite>Mr. Amadio</cite>. “It can be much more cognitively challenging than eating leaves.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tools allow animals to get to food that they couldn’t reach otherwise. And if they can make plans for the future, they can store food to survive hard times.</p>

# pull quote


???
- NOT an HTML element
- block quotation and pull quote are _also_ graphic design/typographic concepts
- a blockquote is in the flow of the document and usually set off by indenting
- a pull quote is lifted from the flow of the document to highlight a concept or otherwise be a lure for the reader
- the original quote is still in the flow of the document and the pull quote may be abbreviated


---
count: false

# Pull quote examples

![an example pull quote](img/05_pullquote1.png)


???
- Simplest design wise
- But also a bit confusing b/c it's laid out more like a blockquote, but as you can see from the highlight, it is actually pulling a quote from earlier in the text
- Also, it's not actually a quote from a source -- it's quoting the article author

# Pull quote examples

# Pull quote examples

![an example pull quote](img/05_pullquote3.png)


???
- Since pull quote _isn't_ an HTML element, how should we mark it up?


---
count: false

# Pull quote markup

```html
<blockquote>
  <p>There's a big part of me that's like, would I have made it in this career if I had student loans?</p>
</blockquote>
```


???
- blockquote
- optional p tag


---
count: false

# Pull quote markup

```html
<blockquote>There's a big part of me that's like, would I have made it in this career if I had student loans?</blockquote>
```


???
- Why use the extra markup?
- If your blockquote has:
  - Has more than one paragraph
  - Wants to share the styles on your p element

# `i` vs. `em` vs. `b` vs. `strong`


???
While you may think to yourself that b stands for bold, i for italic, none of these should be used simply to achieve those font styles and weights.
1. Markup should be used for a _reason_.
2. If you rely on these tags, you generally have less control over the font vs specifying something in CSS -- ie, b may give you bold, but maybe you actually want the black font weight.


---
count: false

# `i` vs. `em`

## `i`

- technical terms
- foreign language phrases
- fictional character's thoughts

--
count: false

---
count: false

# `b` vs. `strong`

## `b`
- keywords

???

--
count: false

## `strong`

- seriousness or urgency

# Troubleshooting & assistance

.text-smaller[
**1. Review your current code:**
- Are you using `blockquote` for your pull quotes?
- Are your pull quotes _true_ pull quotes?
- Are you using `b`, `em`, `i`, `strong` with good reason?
- If not, replace with a span and we'll learn how to use those for applying italics and varied font weights later today.

**2. Add web fonts.**
Make sure to:
- Request the weights and styles you want and only those
- Include at least 1 specific fallback font.

**3. Continue to work on styles for project 1.**

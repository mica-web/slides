# Waterfall

This process is described as "waterfall" -- but I think of it more like a relay race where folks do their bit, then pass the baton/project off to the next stage.

## Issues:

- v lengthy process
  - so much can change from the start of the project to the completion: staff, design ideas, priorities
- b/c designers and developers not working together, often results in static design assets
  - not responsive
  - don't show interaction and animation
  - often don't use real(istic) content
- process doesn't make as much sense when you're working on a web product vs web site or in an agency
  - talk about the difference between a web site and a web product

# Waterfall vs. Agile

Obviously not the only way to go about this. Enter "agile."

- Learn fast and iterate (ie, make changes/adapt).
- Two-week sprints
- Highly collaborative






# Best practices
- content first strategy
- mobile first design; even wireframes (helps w/ prioritization, understanding markup, can start user testing right now)
styles tiles, component-based design

- deal with extreme cases

???
- Wayfinding encompasses all the ways in which people orient themselves and navigate from place to place
- Navigation is the system set up for us, wayfinding is what we/users do in the field or in reality
- Navigation is a crucial part of our web experiences
- Because it's so important, I'm going to go more in depth than is necessary for you to complete project 4 in the hope that this will be helpful to you in the future

![mystery meat navigation](img/11_mysterymeat.png)

# Wayfinding


???
We've talked mostly about what we provide to users--navigation. Let's jump back to the user experience of wayfinding for a few.


--
count: false

## Two types of users

???

- Looking for something in a store with my brother, I'll always be confident I can find a thing, he always looks for someone to ask; these same patterns exist on the web: link-dominant vs search-dominant behaviors; need to consider both

--
count: false

- ### link-dominant
- ### search-dominant


???

- Unlike a store, a web site has no sense of scale vs a store or museum
- No sense of direction
- Little sense of location; no "along the way" placemarkers
- @timer 3m / 31


---
class: center, middle, title
count: false

# Q&A


???

- Not an exhaustive survey of navigation -- more complex nav patterns exist, but should be reserved for truly complex needs -- not just leaned on b/c team or client doesn't want to prioritize nav options for users
- @timer 5m / 36


---

# Quick navigation test

1. ID this site
1. What page am I on?
1. What are the major sections of this site?
1. What are my options at this level?
1. Where am I in the scheme of things?
1. How can I search?

???
- do a handful of these; @timer 10m / 45

???
- Wayfinding encompasses all the ways in which people orient themselves and navigate from place to place
- Navigation is the system set up for us, wayfinding is what we/users do in the field or in reality
- Navigation is a crucial part of our web experiences
- Because it's so important, I'm going to go more in depth than is necessary for you to complete project 4 in the hope that this will be helpful to you in the future

- questions (last, as they will impact what we do next)

- @timer=10m/25
- temperature check: how well do folks feel like they understand git at this point?

# Benefits of git


???
- what do you think the benefits of git are for you, not generically?
- any examples you can think of and share where git might have saved you?
- @timer=5m/30
- reading used an author, but that's obviously  not the common or only use case

# Benefits of git

- one of the reasons I'm keen to use git + GitHub here is for code review.
- examples of code review from last semester

# Benefits of git

![code review](img/02_git_help2.png)


???
- w/o GH, I just have to send you a doc and make comments like "on line 33, you xyz"...but, line 33 may be different for you locally vs the code I'm reviewing if you've made changes :(
- so, while getting new dev environments set up is difficult, stressful and a rough way to start a course, I really really believe it will be worthwhile for all of us

# Intro to git

# Before git

.center[![empty directory](img/02_git2.png)]


???
We have a directory of our project files: multiple files, can even include other directories. In no way limited by file type.


---
class: center, middle, title

# `git init`


???
- `init` is short for "initialize"
- the `git init` command says "This directory is now a git repo, git commands should work in here and maintain a record of changes"


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add1.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center
count: false

## `git init`


???
- `init` also gives us some git concepts: working directory, staging area and repo
- these are all **CONCEPTS**, not actual folders
- not about creating v1, v2, v3 of a file -- but identifying and knowing how git is tracking things
- working directory: where git is initialized, where you do your work
- there are commands to activate the other 2 concepts (staging and repo), so let's dig into those next
- @timer=5m/40


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add1.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center

## `git add`

???
- there are commands to activate the other 2 concepts (staging and repo), so let's dig into those next
- activates the **staging area**
- staging area: a holding cell for files you're going to add to your repo


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add2.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center
count: false

## `git add`


???
- can move a single file over


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_add3.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center
count: false

## `git add`


???
- or several/all
- you do this every time you want to add your changes to the repo
- changes are still in this middle zone, not yet attached to the project repo
- we do that via `git commit`
- @timer=5m/45


---
background-image: url(img/02_git_commit.png)
class: bkgd-contain, center

## `git commit`


???
- we do that via `git commit`
- a **commit** applies all the changes in your staging area to the local repository and to the history of the project
- **repo**: git's current version of your project
- a commit is not the same as a save
- save is to your working directory, always local
- we'll talk more in detail about commits shortly, but for now the important distinction is that a commit is to your project history, a save is to your working directory
- if it's helpful, think of your code like prepping a care package:
    - add/staging is the prep before you mail the package, gathering up all the things that are going to go in your envelope or box
    - a commit is actually mailing the thing
    - while you can see a commit as the conclusion to a narrative, it's not that final: you can still send further letters/packages!

- gitlab, bitbucket other services that also use git in similar ways
- This really isn't important for you right now, but since we're only working in GitHub, I want to make it clear that you have other options down the road

- `git --version`


???
- open up VS Code
- make terminal visible
- control + tilda/` on mac
- control + ` (backtick) on win
- most of what we'll do w/ git in VS Code can be done via the GUI vs command line, but this requires the command line/terminal
- asking your computer if it knows about the command "git" and, if so, what version is installed

# VS Code + git


???
1. in the browser, go to GitHub and log in
1. create a GH repo
    - to keep things simple, make the repo name == the directory name
1. post it note verify

- @timer=5m/90

1. in VS Code, open your directory from last week
  - Sites/GD220
1. push an existing repository from the command line
  > `git remote add origin https://github.com/mica-web/test2.git`

  > `git push -u origin master`
- https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/
  > `git config --global github.user USERNAME`

  > `git config --global github.token YOUR_TOKEN`

1. add and commit via UI
1. diff via UI
1. push again via UI
1. verify on GitHub

# Best practices for commits


--
count: false

- Be useful
- Be brief (~50 char)


--
count: false

1. `Add new font files`
1. `Make header responsive`
1. `Fix typo`


???
- useful = what does this change?
- brief and starts with a verb in the present tense, like giving a command
- does **not** need to mention which file you worked on
- @timer=3m/103


---
count: false

# Best practices for commit messages


- **not** `Thursday's work`


???
- why is this less than ideal?
> A commit is not a reference to a working period (e.g., "Friday's work") because you would never want to undo a whole day; you'd much more likely want to undo discrete bits of that day's work
- commit represents a task or chunk of work that is somehow connected
- common issue for new git users is to get lost in the work and forget to commit; this muddies the water and makes it harder to understand your changes, your intent and definitely impacts your ability to undo things
- if it helps, write out a task list _before_ you start working/coding; each one of those tasks could be a commit

# git branches


???
- when we created our repo, GH gave us a default branch, which is titled "master"


--
count: false

![creating a branch in git](img/02_branch2.png)


???
- any commits we've added to date, have gone to this master branch


---
count: false

# Git branches

.center[![creating a branch in git](img/02_branch3.png)]


???
- this is one way to go -- but it's less than ideal:
    - master is considered the authoritative source / production code
    - while I can look at your commits to master, it's not the best way to handle code review
- @timer=5m/116


---
count: false

# Git branches


???
- let's explore another way
- we use branches to isolate our work, especially when working on teams, and, in this course, to get feedback on things via pull requests (which is a request to have your branch be integrated or merged into the master branch)


---
count: false

# Git branches

.center[![creating a branch in git](img/02_branch4a.png)]


???
- creating a new branch is like using "File save as..." on a document; it takes the current state of your repo and creates a duplicate of it


---
count: false

# Git branches

.center[![creating a branch in git](img/02_branch4b.png)]


???
- you can commit to a branch just like we did to master

# Git branches


???
- while master and our new branch have diverged, at some point we're going to want to connect them back up together again
- we do this via a process called merging


---

# Git branches in VS Code

.center[![branches in VS Code UI](img/02_branch-master.png)]


???
- in VS Code, you can see what branch you're working on in the the status bar, on the far left
- and can create new branches via UI
- branch names cannot have spaces in them


---
count: false

# Git branches in VS Code

.center[![git push from UI](img/02_git-push.png)]


???
- you can also do this through the UI
- click the three dots on the far right of the source control sidebar
- verify on GitHub.com

???
or, put another way...


---
count: false

# Lists

## 2 types

1. bulleted/unordered
1. numbered/ordered


???
- we used ordered lists when the order of the items is important: a top 5 list or step-by-step instructions


---

# Lists

List tags are **nested**


--
count: false

```html
<ul>
  <li>tacos</li>
  <li>sharks</li>
  <li>Beyonce</li>
</ul>
```


???
- wrapping tag sets what kind of list it is
- LI identifies each list item


---

# Lists


```html
<ol>
  <li>Step 1!</li>
  <li>Step 2?</li>
  <li>PROFIT!!</li>
</ol>

what are some other things a link can do?

<p>This link to <a href="http:\\mica.edu" target="_blank">MICA</a> is nested inside a paragraph.</p>

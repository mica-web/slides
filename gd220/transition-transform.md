# `transition-property`

- which property should be affected


---

# `transition-duration`

- how long should transition last
- provide value in `s` or `ms`


---

# `transition-timing-function`

- use the keywords: `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`, `linear`
- optional! default is `ease`

# `transition` shorthand

`transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay];`

.text-smaller[ðŸ’¡brackets are just for display -- do not include them in your code!]

_must_ include property and duration:
`transition: all 1s;`

# 2 reminders about `transition`

1. Not all properties can be transitioned
1. Use the shorthand if you want
    - _must_ include property and duration
    - other properties are optional
1. Skip vendor prefixes

1. Download Visual Studio Code
    - if you haven't already and don't have a text editor you're comfortable with
    - all my examples going forward -- including how to compile Sass on your local machine, how to update your projects on GitHub -- will use Visual Studio Code, so I *highly* recommend using this editor for the class

# Understanding git

???
- type of version control
- functionality you may be familiar with from word documents: track changes, undo/redo
- you can see what changed, who changed it and why
- also can *revert* to previous versions of code
- remembers things even after you deleted 'em

???
- not just for one file, but a snapshot of a whole project (which git calls a repository)
- not limited by number of files or types of files
- does not autosync; up to the user

- git != github
- GH is a web site that hosts git repositories and provides a bunch of additional tools for social coding

## Best practices for commit messages

- Commit early
- Commit often
- Be useful
- Be brief (~50 char)
- Start with a verb in the present tense, like giving a command:
- Update body font to Roboto
- Fix typo in nav
- Note tense: not updates or fixed
- Doesn't need to mention which file you worked on

# VS Code + git

- Create a repo for your class projects
- branches vs master
- pull requests
- merging
